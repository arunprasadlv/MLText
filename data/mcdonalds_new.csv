Las Vegas,"Went through the drive through and ordered a #10 (cripsy sweet chili chicken wrap) without fries- the lady couldn't understand that I did not want fries and charged me for them anyways. I got the wrong order- a chicken sandwich and a large fries- my boyfriend took it back inside to get the correct order. The gentleman that ordered the chicken sandwich was standing there as well and she took the bag from my bf- glanced at the insides and handed it to the man without even offering to replace. I mean with all the scares about viruses going around... ugh DISGUSTING SERVICE. Then when she gave him the correct order my wrap not only had the sweet chili sauce on it, but the nasty (just not my first choice) ranch dressing on it!!!! I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed."
Chicago,"Phenomenal experience. Efficient and friendly staff. Clean restrooms, good, fast service and bilingual staff. One of the best restaurants in the chain."
Los Angeles,"Ghetto lady helped me at the drive thru. Very rude and disrespectful to the co workers. Never coming back. Yuck!"
New York,"Close to my workplace. It was well manged before. Now it's OK. The parking can be tight sometimes. Like all McDonald's, prices are getting expensive."
Portland,"I've made at least 3 visits to this particular location just because it's right next to my office building.. and all my experience have been consistently bad.  There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.  Not going back if I can help it."
Houston,"Why did I revisited this McDonald's  again.  I needed to use the restroom  facilities  and the women's bathroom didn't have soap, the floor was wet,  the bathroom stink, and the toilets were nasty. This McDonald's is very nasty."
Atlanta,"This specific McDonald's is the bar I hold all other fast food joints to now. Been working in this area for 3 years now and gone to this location many times for drive-through pickup. Service is always fast, food comes out right, and the staff is extremely warm and polite."
Dallas,"My friend and I stopped in to get a late night snack and we were refused service. The store claimed to be 24 hours and the manager was standing right there doing paper work but would not help us. The cashier was only concerned with doing things for the drive thru and said that the manager said he wasn't allowed to help us. We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous. I think the manager should be fired."
Cleveland,"Friendly people but completely unable to deliver what was ordered at the drive through.  Out of my last 6 orders they got it right 3 times.  Incidentally, the billing was always correct - they just could not read the order and deliver.  Very frustrating!"
,"Having visited many McDonald's over the years, I have to say that this one is the most efficient one ever! Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this."
