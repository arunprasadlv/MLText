Links to the video recordings can be found under each section below. Alternatively, you can [view all of the videos on one page](http://www.dataschool.io/mltext3-videos/), or [view the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBK1krD5d2P3MMCsnFQHrxj).

### Live Webcasts

Live webcasts will take place every Sunday at 8:00pm ET and every Tuesday at 1:00pm ET. During each 30-minute webcast, Kevin will answer your questions live and/or teach additional concepts outside the course material.

Webcast attendance is optional. You are welcome to post your questions ahead of time, and watch the webcast recording (and read the chat transcript) afterwards.

### Submitting Homeworks

If you would like to submit your homework for review, please post it online (ideally as a Jupyter notebook) and send a link to Alex Egorenkov via Slack. Watch [tips for submitting your homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DxttSSkl60) (6 minutes) to learn how to post your homework online using [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and how to make your Jupyter notebook readable.

### Before the Course

* Make sure that [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) (and their dependencies) are installed on your system. The easiest way to accomplish this is by downloading the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Python. Both Python 2 and 3 are welcome.
* If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, watch my [quick introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYG8B8q722g) (8 minutes). Note that the repository shown in the video is from a previous iteration of the course, and the GitHub interface has also changed slightly.
    * For a longer introduction to Git and GitHub, watch my [11-video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD) (36 minutes).
* If you are not familiar with the Jupyter notebook, watch my [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXXlYVBt1M&t=4m57s) (8 minute segment). Note that the Jupyter notebook was previously called the "IPython notebook", and the interface has also changed slightly. (Here is the [notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/02_machine_learning_setup.ipynb) shown in the video.)
* If you are not yet comfortable with scikit-learn, review the notebooks and/or videos from my [scikit-learn video series](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos), focusing specifically on the following topics:
    * Machine learning terminology, and working with data in scikit-learn ([video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1W4CyPX58&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=3), [notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/03_getting_started_with_iris.ipynb))
    * scikit-learn's 4-step modeling pattern ([video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlQuVL6-qe8&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=4), [notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/04_model_training.ipynb))
    * Train/test split ([video 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pP4EwWJgIU&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=5), [notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/05_model_evaluation.ipynb))
    * Accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC ([video 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dtiMz9tSo&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=9), [notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/09_classification_metrics.ipynb))
* If you are not yet comfortable with pandas, review the notebook and/or videos from my [pandas video series](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos). Alternatively, review another one of my [recommended pandas resources](http://www.dataschool.io/best-python-pandas-resources/).
