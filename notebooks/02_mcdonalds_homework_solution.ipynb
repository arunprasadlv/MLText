I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed. Las Vegas   \n",

Been working in this area for 3 years now and gone to this location many times for drive-through pickup. Service is always fast, food comes out right, and the staff is extremely warm and polite.

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this. na   \n",
