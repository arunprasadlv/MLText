    "## About Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular \"social news\" website run by the startup incubator Y Combinator. It primarily includes news about technology, but also includes job postings and community-generated questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any user can [submit](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit) a post to Hacker News. There are two types of posts: articles and discussions. To submit an **article**, the user includes a title and a URL. To submit a **discussion**, the user includes a title and additional text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can upvote posts that they find interesting. Every post starts at 1 point, and each upvote adds an additional point. The most popular recent posts appear on the front page of Hacker News.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "A [dataset of Hacker News posts](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) is hosted on Kaggle Datasets. It includes about one year of data, ending in September 2016. The following fields are included in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **title:** title of the post\n",
    "- **url:** URL of the post (if any)\n",
    "- **num_points:** number of points that the post received\n",
    "- **num_comments:** number of user comments on the post\n",
    "- **author:** name of the user that submitted the post\n",
    "- **created_at:** date and time the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to predict the likelihood that a post will be \"popular\", based on the data that is available at the time the post is submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the data\n",
    "2. Prepare the data\n",
    "3. Explore the training data\n",
    "4. Feature engineering\n",
    "5. Define **`make_features()`**\n",
    "6. Evaluate your model using cross-validation\n",
    "7. Tune your model using grid search\n",
    "8. Make predictions for the new data\n",
    "9. Use text as the input data instead"

    "2. Unzip **`hacker-news-posts.zip`**, and then move **`HN_posts_year_to_Sep_26_2016.csv`** to a directory where you can easily access it.\n",
    "3. Read the file into a pandas DataFrame called **\"hn\"**.\n",
    "4. Either during or after the file reading process, convert the **created_at** column to datetime format.\n",
