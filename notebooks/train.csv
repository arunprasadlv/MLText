wow do i miss THIS place:

- 24hrs
- drive-thru or walk up only
- ridiculously cheap
- ridiculously tasty

of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.

really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober."
1728,"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!"
3853,We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
671,"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  
The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!"
4920,"Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!"
2726,"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage."
4484,"Best muffler shop in town. There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked."
3607,"I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches. I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad. Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled ""The Dali"") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!"
5559,"Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don't like. 

But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too."
1115,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:

The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.

20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.

It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...

By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...

Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""You've been Yelped"" card as I left.

Take that Tastings!!"
4084,"I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I can't wait to go back and try different dishes. I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area."
8480,Best sushi in town.
22,"first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!"
7510,"Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly, and most importantly, delicious. You can order dishes family style and there's plenty of delicious meals to try. My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken, sweeter then Orange Chicken, but the flavor just melts in your mouth. I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp, and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions. They have a good selection of sake and beer as well. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out."
2589,"Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for ""decent"".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!"
4887,I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.
3665,"Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  

The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. 

You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  


I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others)."
9730,"My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids ""love"" RA, but it's mediocre at best.

I'll just list a few things that irk me:
I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!
Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.
The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!
I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!

Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.

Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service. 

Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high."
5539,Good works
4172,Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.
2287,"As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars."
9527,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
9951,"This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The ""Asada y Enchilada"" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere."
2486,"F724 

She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). 

So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 

1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship). 
 
Le sigh... 

Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm"
3306,"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.

The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own."
4856,"Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy."
512,"Phenom. 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. 
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. 
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. 
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. 
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. 
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. 
Service is friendly and quick. 
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. 
Good food. You won't be disappointed."
3739,"Great, fun atomosphere! Service was great! My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.  Average prices but great value! Highly recommend this place for date night!"
4210,"This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.

The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!"
5817,"Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me.
So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!"
421,"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed."
2636,Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.
285,"My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff."
1738,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient! 
Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES. 
I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
1447,"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!"
3155,"Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination."
3358,"I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.

Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.

If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium."
8963,"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"
690,"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest."
3009,"I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert."
5214,"I absolutely LOVE this place. Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!"
2349,"Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly."
5772,"Polite friendly staff. Great, always clean place.  The gym is great and never too crowded."
9298,"My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 

1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 

2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 

3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present. 


Keep Rocking Yasu!!!"
7766,"I'm one of those people that loves frozen yogurt.  Anything that taste this great and is this guilt-free will get me every time.  The Golden Spoon has a variety of flavors of fro-yo, and each delicious flavor is only 88 calories per 4 ounces.  This is good news, my friends.

On top of that, the price is very reasonable.  I got the mini (which is 4 ounces) and it rang up to $2.14.  When I compare it to Desert Swirl (your other choice of fro-yo on the Westside), this is extraordinarily more affordable.

The service was not overly friendly, but just fine.  The ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples.

I highly recommend the Heath flavored fro-yo.  Delicious."
98,"I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)"
6991,"My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made. 

The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!"
4596,Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm
8506,"This is my love note:

Yours beers are so delicious, your food is absolutely scrumptious.  I wish I could spend forever and always with you.  If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking, why, I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River.  You are great, don't change, and please, stay with me forever and always.

9892,"Loved it. Food was great, service was great. Not easy to find, but worth the search!!!"
9010,"There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream.  It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer.  Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn.
I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top.  I can't say anything bad about it at all.  If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains.  
The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia.  I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever:  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail)."
8061,"Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here."
2101,"Great customer service, nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona."
797,"Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else.
My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price.
I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing.
This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying."
9555,"Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their ""stars"" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lol

Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely ."
8917,"Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. 
I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.
Once you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! 
Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. 
Put Paradise Bakery on your ""always good"" list!!"
5715,"YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!"
6889,"Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!"
4138,"It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.  

To the negative experience.....
My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Can't you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.

I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading....
My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling."
7330,"I honestly just got home from visiting Super Farm!  I headed out their way because I wanted to try their milk - we are trying to spend our $$ on local businesses.  It was great to actually speak to the people who raise the cows and see the cows with my own eyes! 

We ended up staying for about two hours!  Everyone was so friendly.  We bought our gallon of milk ($3.49) and some butter ($4.99) and then stayed for lunch.  Chef Matt - I hope I didn't forget his name!- introduced himself while we were buying milk and we decided to stay for lunch . The kids split a kid's cheeseburger and I had the chicken salad - sandwich.  It was fantastic!! 

After lunch we visited the baby cows, the goats, and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk ($1 each - grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son).  

Everyone is so nice here - my children LOVED it and did not want to leave.  Worth the 40-ish minute drive out there.  (We live in South Phoenix)"
7374,I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month. Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed
8082,The folks here are the best!
6367,Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us.
5703,"note: the 5 stars i'm giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu. if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you.



M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.



happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL."
810,"Tiffany @ the chanel counter. 
Tana in the lingerie department. 

these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room. 

but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)"
8516,"I can't believe we get to review a free publication.  Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.  While it's always interesting to hear what people think of Java, knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month."
6369,"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right. 

I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.

The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that."
9069,"This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment."
1285,Great for young kids... tons to do and see
1783,"This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet. 

The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!"
4648,Love it. Wish it was in my neighborhood.
8654,"Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well... 

Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be."
5782,This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap! If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out! First time clients get a discount! I will never go anywhere else!
7311,"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didn't intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when I'm in town."
6298,Love this place.  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing. Love the atmosphere too!
2994,"Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done."

I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist
Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still
I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm
It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.
it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity

so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted
i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job

they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up
the follow up appointment is FREE!

totally recommend this place to any and everyone!"
1028,Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
2243,One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
8887,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location."
4765,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.

 On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). 

After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). 

I won't be doing business here when I move."
5940,"I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL."
8253,"If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour.

I have only ever ordered the Oggie (I'm a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesn't disappoint.

Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  It's also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table."
4024,"How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp?

I reviewed them for Check Please, Arizona!, a PBS review show. http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/. I could at least do a written review. 

I've eaten at FEZ so many times, I can't count anymore. I think their burgers are some of the best I've ever had in the valley. Always juicy, I think the square patties are adorable. 

The FEZ burger, with it's molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, providing fireworks for the tounge. Their Douxelle burger, with sauteed mushrooms, provolone cheese &  mustard, resulting in a subdued but delicious burger.

 Their fries, which include normal, sweet potato, harissa, & garlic are also great, but I love the salad that comes default, including their lemon dressing. 

If burgers & fries aren't your thing, they have Kisras( think like pizza, minus the cheese), and their daily specials are amazing. 

One time, I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto, and it was perfect.  Sugar snap peas, 

Drinks are fantastic too. A margarita that doesn't taste like chemicals, perfect martini's, and a G-Spot(grapefruit, pom, and vodka), make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner."
6614,"I recently decided to accompany a couple friends on their quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix. A few weeks ago we started here at Yasu Sushi Bistro. While I'm not as committed to the quest as they are, I would be surprised if Yasu didn't rank among the top five sushi places in the Valley.

We had an incredible dining experience at Yasu. Our server was perfect: she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations. I'm still somewhat of a sushi novice, but you don't have to be a pro to know when you're eating a fresh, creative meal.

My recommendations: start off with miso soup with clams and try the hamachi carpaccio. At the end of the meal ask your server to have the chef make you something special. He made us tempura avocado wrapped in eel, topped with foie gras and served it to us personally. It was amazing.

Yasu provided one of the best dining experiences I've had all year."
2509,First hole in one on #3. I'll always love you Vistal.
9612,"I have memories that make my mouth water.  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.  They all rave after their experience.  

The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.  Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.  

The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.  

Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours."
7873,"So. After 8 years of owning a Ford, it left me stranded on the road one to many times. 

So I bought a '06 Hyundai Elentra (from a different location). Ive never owned a foreign car, this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty. 

Well....it started to act a little funny. So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work. I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful. 

They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldn't get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue. 

Everything was under my warranty. I was back on the road by the end of day 2! 

I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise. Thanks Tim!"
357,"Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!"
2500,"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products."
1086,"What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.  

The Room was very clean and very comfortable.  

Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.  

The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.  

The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.

The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.  

Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy,"
823,Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
9969,"Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great. She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there. Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too."
1360,"I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended, and if I'm ever back in town, I will visit again."
9207,"Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?  That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.  The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...  The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine."
8483,"I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act."
5851,"This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).  

I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.

It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.  

If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.

Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  I'm going to miss them.  Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there."
9905,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).

Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.

Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.

Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.

All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended."
2440,"I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty."
2456,"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!"
2006,"Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!"
9270,"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!"
8939,I go there often. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Great beers & usually great service
447,"I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good."
9282,"Joe's is truly a special place!! What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940's. The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there. They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste. They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest. The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece. The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!! I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!!"
2748,"Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close. 
It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!"
3813,"Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that."
8138,"Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)

My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).

Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!

Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.

Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!

The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.

The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!

Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)"
1223,"I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;("
7125,"Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.

I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.

The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.

The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.

I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.

Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation."

5571,"In being a bit of a burrito man, I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat.  However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas..."
1407,Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
190,"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend."
5302,"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. 

Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again."
8568,"Waffle House was packed, Over heard another couple taking about ""Fast Eddies"", With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out. Walked in looked like a senior center. Tables and chairs were very out dated. We sat down in a booth. Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty. Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 min later she brought out or coffee. Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food. The diner wasn't busy at all. I don't know why the wait was so long. The food was ok, service was horrible. One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door. Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected. I showed the waitress and she really didn't care. I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out. GROSS! Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again."
5854,"Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better."
9224,"I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well. 
I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate!

 I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.
We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.
Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!"
21,This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
8158,"This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.  I say it's convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).

Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!

I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!"
8760,"I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.  There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.  I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger."
2306,"There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list. 

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. 

The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!"

5637,"I'm giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.

We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result."

I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out.... 
After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD. 
I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. 
I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date.

Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness."

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!

When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.

****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!

In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine ""Northern Italian Cuisine"" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!"
1916,"Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda. 
It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger. 
For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night.
From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit.
This is a must go!"
7800,"On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.
  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).
  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!
Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words! Seriously, you have to try them. Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m. I wish I could order them by the dozen haha"

Whatever you need here ask for them, Jen is the store manager and Mike was more than amazing! They told us that not many people knew about this location and I promised I would change that! Make sure to post your awesome experience next!  I love my ring!!!!"
3932,"I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed. I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place. The food is not only original but good an healthy. I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you. It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful. I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake. the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me. he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table. definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again."
6039,"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.

That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, ""wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."" They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.

The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.

This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here."
8424,Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.
2515,"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."
4995,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!

Scone-dry.
Service-ridiculously slow.
The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were ""disturbing the guitar player.""

Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.

The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather. 

We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.

After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)

Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!

Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.

If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed."
6544,"I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day. And, yep, it's addictive. They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel. It's incredible. I usually pass on toppings.

As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers. But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open. They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust."
6712,"I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the ""outside"" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, ""well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.

We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot."
1390,"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito."
4347,Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines. Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night
7163,"YIKES!! Its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me - cuz it could spell trouble. 
If you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really 'enjoy a silent moment'.....try one of their coconut, lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes. Honestly I didnt care how many calories are in them....I was weak in the knees. 
There is standing room only in this shop  - literally I think my bathroom is bigger -but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes, and kudos on their packaging!!. (its definitely built into the pricing!)"
7340,"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!"
4419,"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk. 

Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."
2162,"After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks."
7899,"I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken."
2777,Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.

Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!

The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!

The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!

I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an ""Asian Sangria""? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!"
3772,"This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around.

Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christopher's, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill. Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day. Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week I'm NOT there :)  .

Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met). Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise you'll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you can't see around. Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if you'll be attending one of these events.

The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet. Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value.

Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!"
2221,"I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.

I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!

Service was friendly and efficient.

Update: 
12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious

12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.

12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.

12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!"
3812,Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!
8025,great wine selection except they are always out of greg norman and ive never got to try it
4154,"Really nice!  I'm new to the area and I stumbled upon them.  They are fast and not very expensive.  I was a little turned off by the number of really old men working there, but they had their regular client list.  It was like one side was ""old men"" hair stylists and the other side was the ""young girl"" stylists.  The two sides didn't really associate, which I found rather weird.  But, none the less, a great hair style at a great price!!!"
6807,"I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY."

Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant."
8067,"You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!"
3656,Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
1361,"It was 3:45pm and I'm about to jump on a bus to the light rail.  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: they're 26th in line.  So in theory, at 5:00 we're in the first seating.  And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, we're sitting down and waiting.  

Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window?

So I guess the point is, if you make it your only point to go to Bianco, it's hard to be disappointed."
998,"Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.

The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.

The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though)."
5056,"Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix.

I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up. 

AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are.

Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger.

It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat."
4209,"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice. 

The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level. 

The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place.

Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"
7741,"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! ""Get more for less!"""

I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   

Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.

Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.
  
Gratzi and Buon Natale.

Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try."

Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.  

It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldn't believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!"

In short, I love my time at Second Chance."
646,Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!
8235,"Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt ""Up scale Mexican Food"" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return."
7708,"Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed. Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet. What more could you want. My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet! My co-workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price! Thumbs up for this place!"
226,"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer."
7827,"As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read ""Good Food Takes Time"" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our ""good food"" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal."
4996,"I love this place!

We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!

We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.

We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.

The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.

This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more."
2534,Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
9266,"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."
4911,"I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened.                                                 It is a good location, lots of parking all around. Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.              There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.  My girlfriend likes it as well. So it is a win win set up. They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here. Even a Barnes and Noble,which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days."
1973,"Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.

It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.

What a deal!

Under 5. bucks including the drink.

I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere."
8919,"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.

Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles."
5079,"Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a ""wellness plan"". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health."
1026,"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.

The Service
My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash."
7780,We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!
7411,"I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great."
8289,We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
1942,Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
4766,Very bad food!
3380,"Dr. Kanarish was exactly how I expected he would be by the other reviews I read on Yelp and Google. His staff was very friendly and the facility is extremely clean. I have an 8 year old Boxer that needed a large tumor type growth removed from his paw and was given very high estimates from different hospitals. Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal, stitches, etc... ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called. I was originally offered care credit( a payment plan) but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason. I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic, so we will see how the next few days go. A great first experience and am planning on transferring all our future visits to see Dr. Karanish. It's great to see there are honest and compassionate Doctors around. I hope anyone looking for an exceptional Dr. will consider Dr. Karanish."
4896,"One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.

What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic."
5894,"Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it."
350,I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
4976,"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The sauce is amazing. Every time I'm in town I get the sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce.

There's nothing else to say, really. Go here for good pizza."
8711,"I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy."
9637,"I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates.

BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasn't locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now.

Internet: I signed up for their ""Heavy Duty"" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise ""up to"" 20 Mbps...

Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line...

The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in I'm at $272.43. I can't make any sense out of the bill so I'm not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools. 

The day this contract is up I'm going back to Cox and I'll be happy to pay more!!"
6344,Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
6561,"being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. 

for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick."
2892,Great Job!
3238,Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
1113,"Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?"
4346,"Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!"
9425,"holy shit i love this place.

I have been a regular here for years. Eating at oregano's after a long work/school week is really something to look forward to.

The food is great. Its reasonably priced, the portions are huge, and the drinks are tall. don't expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here, its just not part of the restaurant's culture. The food is simple and everything is tasty. 

I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich, or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta, and one of their giant meat balls. Its always filling, 
always good.

Sure the wait is long, but they always have free pizza, drinks, and deserts while you are waiting. 

Service is always great. Friendly, prompt, and they don't bother you when you don't need them. All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations, challenges, etc."
472,"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."
1855,"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.
I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time."

2518,"I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip. 

Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks. 

Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work."
4458,"Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.

The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  

The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. 

The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.

Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  

Lunch

The lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.

Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit."
3509,"LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!

The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly."
1414,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...

The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.

P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
3241,"Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life."
7215,"This place is so cool
i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this
It reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene.
There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kinds
from what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt
i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get another

729,"This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!"
2942,"They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company."

6565,"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."
6302,"This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say ""Winning!!!!""

I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  

I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  

I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor"
2356,"I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.

Detail:

Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.

I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.

It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.

Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.

This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain."

6656,"I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this."
3915,"Yo, this is my favorite AJ's here. If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else. Actually, the prices aren't any higher than Safeway, they just carry better, and more expensive for them to buy, products. 

They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving. The sandwich counter is awesome, and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head. The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas. Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and I'm so so so happy. 

This store is much larger than the Scottsdale/Lincoln location, and the service here is friendlier than that location as well. Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter, she is teriffic, as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time. You guys rock!"
504,"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

Food
1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them."
5165,"Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY.
Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day).
I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)"
9860,"Aside from the Macy's on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.  They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.  Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.  There's a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.  

I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.  They also have a personal shopper near the women's dressing rooms.  Not that I'd ever have the need for one but you might.  The sales people are always really nice and helpful.

On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.  I've always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself ""I'm standing where the late great Janis stood.""  She's one of my all times."
8148,"Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in. I am dog sitting my friend's dog. They are on vacation. Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable. I called at 5:15. They got me in at 5:30. Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me. Explained everything to me thoroughly. Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable. Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it. EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops. I am in awe. I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know. I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people. THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC. YOU ROCK!!!!!!! I will now be taking my own little guy there. You guys are now the only vet I will ever use."
1343,"Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.  I freaking love Nordstrom!  

The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly.  I have never had such good service anywhere else.  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.

Aside from the service, the selection is very nice.  I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!

I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.  They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.  Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.

If you go, go in June or  January when the sales are great!  Make sure you check out the shoes!"
7492,"In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps.

Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.

Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.

I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all.

This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop."
2543,This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.
1052,"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.

This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.
There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.
I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.

Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.
The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.

On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.

Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.
I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.
Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.
Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.
I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when
."
4643,"ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow."
1473,"Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.  

It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out."
825,"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight."
813,"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."
5263,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning."
1858,Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
1032,"I love this place.  The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello, customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.  You won't be disappointed."
3741,"Family friendly and we love the soups and salads.  Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!!  We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious.  Sunday brunch is great too.  We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum.  Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick.  We'be been going for years and will continue to go.  Oh, did I mention the free WiFi?  Great for some business lunches."
1172,"Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!

Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side."
728,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
2247,Love the wings!
7792,"LOVE the Four Peaks. Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but I've never ever not had a fun night there.  The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standards

The fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . it's fantastic.  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!  And the Rueben might just be the best in town.

The happy hour is great.  $3 locally brewed pints?  Sign me up

The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.  I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.  Next time they'll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season"
1603,"BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.

A few tips:
1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 
2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.
3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.

There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout."
5093,"My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side."
617,Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
2249,"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem."
1363,Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
3992,"are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip."
5064,"lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross. 

Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it. 

The men's side of the store doesn't carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if you're overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you don't look like a muffin when you put them on. 

I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the women's shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried! 

If you haven't been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals."
3982,Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!
9046,"Busy place, but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination. They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early..."
8119,Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.
570,"This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good. 

I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now."
2895,"Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!

Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!"
5014,"I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't ""feel"" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch."
9361,Huge Fan of this place. People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service. Huge fan of the sandwiches.
7151,"This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!

This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.

The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!! 

This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.

If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it. But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet."
9595,"It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff.  I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms.  They have a stretch room, full wet area with steam and sauna, free aerobics classes,  a large number of equip,etc.

The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment, so I try to get in and out before 5 or so.

All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area."
8474,"If you want a good meal that will fill ya up, for a fair price...Wally's is a great choice!

The menu has great variety.  If you want a burger, there are many to choose from.  Each is huge and juicy, and comes with your choice of a side....go with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries.

Want a salad?  Again, many to choose from...my favorite is the chinese chicken.  And, in case you missed my earlier comments, expect a BIG salad.

And, if you're not watching your calories, then try any of their specialty mac'n'cheese dishes.  WOW!

I can't comment on the desserts because I can't eat anything beyond the entrees...but, I've seen others order a dessert; they looked yummy and - you guessed it - HUGE!

And, here's the thing about Wally's:  they're ""good people"".  in addition to providing you with a great meal, Wally's staff are active supporters of non-profit organizations in the greater Phoenix area.  I have first-hand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale.  I have no doubt they support other causes."

7660,"This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!"
7915,"We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed. Never the less, the service was impeccable as always. This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...can't vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red ""leather""? booths are welcoming. It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent."
5460,"ALTERNATIVE!!

That's what this place is and in the land of BIG chains, this only could add some spice. We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event. The personnel is totally committed to their project. 

If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don't enjoy (but others do - horror), this is a good alternative."
4942,Love this lake. Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time. Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom. Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :)
6941,"I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-4 and ordered carry-out once. Every single time my experience was great. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us. It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food. At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying. This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best. The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming. A big open room for the dinning space works well."

Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!"

Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars."
7219,"5 stars? Definitely!

Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections. The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night. 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes. 

We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was ""my favorite,"" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly. 

It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo. Like, now."
182,"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! 

Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).

Nice laid back decor too.

You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!

The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)

I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!"
9617,"As a massage therapist I normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted, that was before Dr. Hunt came to town.  I trust him implicitly, and the techniques he uses are amazing. I take my four year old to see him too, who always greets Dr. Hunt and Larissa with great big hugs. Highly recommend this office, truly feels like family"
7039,"I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)"
3440,"I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place."
3469,"""The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."""
7366,"Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same."
124,"I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!"
3697,"If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's ""dining style"" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best."
331,"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)"
8645,"This location opened up just 3 weeks ago, and offers high quality, natural products for mainly cats and dogs, although there is a very basic small animal section.  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious, healthier, and that don't have corn or soy in them. There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.  Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.  I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.

Jill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!"
9175,"After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, that's really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Beckett's Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!"
4374,"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time."
6878,"Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!"
5985,"We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. 

I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience."
5951,"Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort, they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there.

Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort?  I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix.  I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet.  That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities.  They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.

After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.  I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, ""OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!""  Ha!  Very funny.  After that first time, I didn't have any trouble finding my way back to it again.  My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward.  I was pretty much set.

I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly).  He gave me a room on the third floor that was ""overlooking the pool"" (P.S. all rooms are ""overlooking the pool"").  He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was.  It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did.  There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn't matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).

The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings.  My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower.  The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron.  There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate.  There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio.  There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs.  The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so.  I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn't have a trouble getting out of bed either.  Perfect.

Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.  The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok.  I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning.  By the second day, I was greeted by name.  That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.

Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn.  Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home.  Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn't bother me.  The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down.  I didn't go to any of the happy hours (friends don't let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!

Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map.  I made this huge circuitous route because I didn't know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying.  Next time I will know!!

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort.  Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don't need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby).  Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!
Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it's got it all."
4836,"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!"
5394,"Another 5 star review. I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldn't stop talking about it. 
(It was her reward for having good grades) 
I know I'm supposed to be the reviewing the theater, but I can't bring myself to rate them lower than 5. It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater,  they still deserve 5 stars. The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements. (Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldn't see, so I changed seats with her.)  No big deal. 
Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always. 
Thank you again to yelp, Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets. My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show. :)"
6741,The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.
1612,"I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.  

Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!"
5596,"Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor."
588,"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!"
4636,"Ahhh Shady's...I am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place, but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it.  Cool atmosphere, just the right lighting (very important to me), great bartenders, good prices on a really nice selection (Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia?).   This is definitely not a dive bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's not an icey, blase Snobbsdale-ish joint either, and I've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender.  I've seen all walks of life come through this place, but never felt that it was too 'hip' or pretentious in any way. Great jukebox, obscure, forgotten movies playing on the telly, bartenders that are nice to look at (male and female), have personality and actually remember your name (and drink).  Does it get any better than this?"
8730,Yum! Healthy selections and delicious flavors!
7737,"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there)."
6076,"Lots of ""gay on gay"" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well"
6108,"This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!

Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. 

We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!"
1259,"Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.  

There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.  

I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made."
4010,Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.
9498,"Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats. Very laid back gastropub with a friendly, funny/entertaining staff!  We grabbed drinks at the bar first - Moe'scow Mule (ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) & the Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, rocks) which were both good, not too strong, but a good refreshing drink.

Appetizers:
1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut)
2) The Original Chopped Salad
Please order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially.

Entrees:
1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy.
2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique)
3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was! Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat. The mashed potatoes were very good as well."
4201,"Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago. 

There still might be someone in line tho..."
6291,"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.
I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. 

Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.

Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.

Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.

I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal ""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165"", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."
2613,This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
2075,"Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to ""enhance"" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door."
7135,Free samples? One dollar churros? Cheap buys? Why not.
1791,"Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.

I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. 

By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.

I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!"
9632,"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and ""old"" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)"
6576,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
4803,"I had such a great experience with Love Carpet Care and Repair. They were friendly and courteous and enthusiastic every time I spoke to them on the phone, and their work was incredible.  

I hired them to clean a carpet in an apartment.  The leasing office at the apt complex told me the carpet was in such bad shape they would have to trash it.  (Quick aside: I did not live in the apartment, but I was responsible for the damage...)  Love Carpet Care did such a good job cleaning the carpet it looked nearly new again.  Truly outstanding.  

And, most importantly, the price they quoted me beforehand - when I gave them an honest account of the condition and size - was the final price.  Love it!  And it was cheap.  I was desperate and upset enough that they really could have charged me anything, but they were wonderful.  Honest, hardworking, helpful.

I could never say enough good things about this company."
1878,"I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a ""limited"" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back."
8501,"I love this place! I've been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times. They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more. The employees are very friendly and helpful. 

Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I haven't seen a single item priced over $100.  I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)"
7803,"I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."
8758,"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there."

7533,"Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star???

Pros: Friendly & enthusiastic staff, incredible products, lots of samples, phenomenal smells, reasonable prices, and get this, an HONEST company!!! Read their bag, it'll make you love them more.

Cons: if you're sensitive to smells, brace yourself.  Also, if you're the type that wants to be left alone while you shop, beware.  The staff is excited about their products.

Don't miss: R&B hair moisturizer (it drives men crazy!), Coalface facial cleanser & Brazen Honey exfoliating mask."
9108,"What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays."
8582,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
3504,"They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.
It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!

There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!
The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change. 
Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place."
5240,"Green....how I love thee.  Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!  

The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).

Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!

 (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!"
4660,"Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.

They've got soda, lots of soda.  That's right, I said soda! They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things. 

I love this place, I have no complaints. The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer. Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!"
1199,Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
8216,"My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended."
6489,"I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable. 

 I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!"
9231,"Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!"
5750,"Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids."
4968,Excellent.
5264,"i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.

i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....

this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless."
2745,"I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it."
2950,"This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.

3390,"Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!

The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.

They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.

I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!

Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.  

It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's ""chill"" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.

It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!

Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!"
2887,"Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home."
1355,"When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!!
HATS OFF FOR FnB!!"
9898,"Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says ""I know dude"".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping. 

Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time."
3356,"I love this place. I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied. The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice. I'm so lucky to live down the street! Tons of vegan options, too."
6772,"Caught Louis CK here last night... 

Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning. It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze. The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about. Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite... I love it. 

L.O.V.E.

If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive. It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them. This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint. I can't recommend this place enough."
7093,"I've been coming here for several years.  Can't find my first review.  I guess it was too long ago.  So here comes another one.
The woman who runs the place.  I've forgotten her name.  She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet.
When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.  With ajvar and onion, this can't be beat no matter how you my search around.  The sausages, cevap, are delicious and what's unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.  Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for.
A very favorite of ours.
I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten.
One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.  It's not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.  
Everything is simply top shelf."
1019,A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
7544,"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!"
84,"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred."
1693,"When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) ""a kid in a candy store."" 

It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!

The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second). 

Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!"
2671,"What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!"
4115,"Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I won't hear a word against them. Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me. They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour. The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming. I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano. Mmm, so good! The shrimp chimi is also fantastic. I never leave without feeling totally stuffed."
886,"I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive."
1145,"Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!"
8599,"I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic, but I'm glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them.

Dr. Frank Sorrentino is a true professional. I've suffered from low back issues for years and Dr. Frank always knows how to treat the problem. Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition I'm glad to report I've been in good shape for a while.

Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go."
9603,"Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona. It's unrivaled and it maintains it's crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores. Empty stores are rare. Try that on for size, PV mall. 


The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat. Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations."
1222,"Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends."
1328,"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
1406,"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere."
3660,"Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!
 Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!"
547,"I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her."
7726,"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad."
8256,"The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner."
2600,"I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it."
7978,Good JIB. Fast an friendly.
6297,Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!
2623,"I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. 

Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. 

There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. 

The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.

It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
9991,"Only 4 stars? 

(A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.)

Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.

The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about!

I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. I've been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time."
5915,Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.
6915,"Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so.

Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.

Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.

Husband had:

Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.

Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.

Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).

I had:

Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.

Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)

Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.

Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.

Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors."
9846,"NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.  

One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this."
1431,"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here. 

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!"
1498,"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!"
9262,"Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable."
7457,"Along with Bliss, FEZ is another one of my fav brunch spots. They have $3 specialty drinks (mimosas, bloody marys, bellinis...). The service is always quick and the servers are always attentive and very patient with my ridiculous modifications. They have a drink called a ""g-spot"" and it is fresh grapefruit, grapefruit juice, ruby red vodka and soda. It is unbelievable and on thursdays they are $3 (i think) The menu is different with kasras and stylish burgers but somehow we always fill up on the appetizers. The cheese fondue and the little pyllo pockets are my favs. Ive never been disappointed at FEZ and I absolutely will continue to recommend it and go back! (Thanks thomas for the corrections!)"
4194,"So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time.  I gotta say the technician, Christine, was great!  She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable.  It was very clean, the wax isn't to hot, and the technician never double dipped.  I found the place very clean and comfortable.  Pricing is just right too.  I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop.

I did get told about product as others reviewed.  However, I didn't feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why.  In addition, she told me of other uses for the product.  

It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed."
4029,Great food! Good prices.
3329,"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."
9592,"One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!"
1254,"Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!

We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. 

Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back."
1522,"Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!"
8959,"Like Sex or Tobacco? Hells yeah!!!! were not looking for vanilla yes' here, this place pulls out all the stops

If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here.

The best selection of DVD's and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up.

9781,"Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!"
3794,"Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office.      I'm so grateful that I found this place and met Dr. Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant, Melissa.  My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts.   Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG.   I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research.  I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision.  Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years.   I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before.  She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you.   I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much!    Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters, I fully recommend Dr. Strand."
276,"Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. 

Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff."
1456,"What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.

What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it."
5486,"I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?"
7502,"As good as all the others, and closer to home than most."
6127,"Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!    If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!    Parking so easy and close as well."
4962,Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
292,"Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold."
9965,"Treats: We tried the cookies (chocolate chip and chocolate truffle) and would have to give them 5stars. Delicious!  
Breakfast: Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor, but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option. 
**If you go, be sure to check out the bathrooms. Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member, and  the sinks are shared by both genders. You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms, so that is a great bonus.  Overall, a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food."
9183,"The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   

My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver."
3709,"Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible."
3548,"Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.  I found the decor charming and elegant.  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit."
2422,"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best."
9501,"Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco? 

Yes. Yes they do.

Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis? 

Oh hell yeah!

Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.

If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).

If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin'. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden.

And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: ""The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!"" Do I stutter? Nope.

While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it.

I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria. And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.

I've eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick. The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better. I can't recommend highly enough."
3817,"Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.  

My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!

The atmosphere was also great.  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.  

I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!"
9579,"I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time ""real job"" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.

It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100. 

I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted."
1634,"Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said ""OMG!  This is so good!""  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, ""Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch.""  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future."
4110,"Had a fantastic experience! Hernan, our server was excellent. Knowledgable and charming. The food was fantastic. The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane. Crazy flavor. Well done!"
3300,"Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!"
4360,"This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.  

The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!

I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.  The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!

I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.  I advise you to do the same!"
5692,"Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!

The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.

Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard."
4883,"I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito. Fortunately just 3 days ago, a menu was left on our door for Cisco's Grill (with some great marketing I might add). Conveniently located right up the street from my house, I've been curious about this place since they opened! I strapped on my shoes and walked on over... upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese... The cook went to work and 5 minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water! Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes. Its clear to me that he's very passionate about his restaurant! The service is top notch!

The menu itself is fairly generic, typical burger and fries, tacos and burritos, but everything is so fresh and prepared well! I'd recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat!"
3080,"This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.

I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.

Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.

The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!"
5801,ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!
1054,"Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'

This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food."
8391,"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai we've ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants. 

We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings. 

The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed."
5455,"Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so, I've eaten lunch just about everywhere. There are plenty of good places, but not many ethnic places... Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic. I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!

I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually... But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap. I keep asking myself, how can it be so good? Is it cocaine? Cocaine in the food?! Is it?!

They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine. On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!

Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding, 'cause it's delicious."
9558,"Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!  I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.

The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new. 

They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.  


I will definitely be going back for more!"
9008,"I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.  It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.  BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.  It's a classy, family oriented pizza place. 

We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza. Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.  Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value! winning!)(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.  They were the small kind and they were just great.  The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.  

We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.  Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.  

We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there."
7859,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian. 

He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself. He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! 

He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?

And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product. Talk about mouth watering.    

Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table."
5148,"Haus Murphy's is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here. Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.

The service was wonderful. I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot. . . Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi). The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.

My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters. If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's. 

Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit. 

Enjoy!"
5678,"Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views. For our meals, we got the following:

[Amuse bouche]
I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.

[Appetizer]
Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.
Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.
Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.

[Entree]
Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it.
Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.

[Dessert]
Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.

After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!

The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!

Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!"
6855,"I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.

Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. 
Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. 

Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.
I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. 

I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)"
415,"As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied. 

I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!  

Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet."
7394,"The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong."
3667,"Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd. 

Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!"
869,"Sushi ken I love you so much, I don't even know where to start! It's about time I write a review. This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.
  Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A. Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you, please just don't come and spare me your stupid review, just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that.
My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks, I feel like the staff is our family. They are very nice and polite. A lot of families here, restaurant is decorated simply. 
Nigeri and sashimi are very good. UNI here is amazing! Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad.
From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl.
I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9."
1297,"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.

When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.

Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.

The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre."
7547,"Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.

The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.

Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.

Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. ""Turkey"", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend."
8278,"Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit."
6603,"What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!"
679,Excellent burger
7153,Love this place. Everyone is fantastic. The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect.
1445,So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
201,"A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!"
6953,"I think I may be addicted to this place. This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place. All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered. I've been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table. The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly. The drink specials aren't too bad either. You can't go wrong!"
6264,"This is my current first choice in eateries.  The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables, it melts in your mouth, and there are so many different kinds, ave price 3-4.00.  Did I say they are HUGE?  It's a weight watchers dream.  Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully.  The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out.  The best thing of all, though, is the Ginger Creme Brule.  Wow, sir.  It doesnt get better than that.  If you like Viet food, Thai food, or just plain fresh, good food, then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest.  My goal is to try everything on the menu."
5764,"Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had it's share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved. 
The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun. This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members. Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down. I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience."
9026,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.

You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.

It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.

If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.

And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."
6734,"Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  

My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.  

We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi!

Domo Arigato!"
6311,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  

I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
9066,The french toast was delicious! Toddy was especially good
7802,"I called several pool service companies before choosing Desert Gator Pool Service.  

When we bought our house I insisted to my husband that we could take care of the pool...all we needed was someone to come check the chemicals once a month.  Oh sure.  After about one week, mustard algae, a bad storm, and a cranky pool pump, we were looking for a pool guy.

We called them on a Saturday and the owner of Desert Gator was kind enough to come to our home at 6:00am the following Monday to fit with our schedules.  We had our service set up that week and have been very happy ever since.  

They definitely got our pool under control and taught us quite a bit along the way.  We still have them coming once every week - it's so worth it.  Our pool was in bad shape after a recent storm and they were incredibly responsive.  I think they came two or three times that week without charging us more.

$85 per month...but can be a bit more if you need parts and chemicals."
2222,"No need for a long review.

Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.

Great Food
Great Customer Service

Love this place"
6042,"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time."
5108,"Of course it gets hot in the summer. You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'. 

Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well."
8050,"""No.""  

If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 

0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  

0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.

In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  

The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.

On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  

There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!

When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 

6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.

Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  

6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  

6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  

6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.

6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."
6073,"This is one super cool cafe/lounge.  They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.  Wi-Fi friendly, too!"
2522,"YUUKK!!!

That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.   

...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.

The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.

In short.  I will not be going back here."
2787,I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
4833,Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.
4943,"This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!"
9188,"""Fake"" (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No ma'am"" or ""Yes, ma'am""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.

They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."
1654,"Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!"
4988,I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.
8796,I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was. Delicious food.
654,"Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet."
6956,"AZ 88 is a great date location.  The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the ""old"" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!)."
2340,"I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!

It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.

How do you say, ""Damn that was good!"" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).

The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.

There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.

It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!"
4734,"The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless."
3500,"This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.

We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement ""bar"" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement ""tables"" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up! 

Great job, Peoria!"
9194,Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good
3168,"Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!"
7057,"Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. 

If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. 

Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. 

I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. 

Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.

If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  

After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line."
6885,"Only 10 min away from walking distant.

6715,"Excellent pizza, great service, family environment in a beautiful setting.  That sounds like a tagline on a website, but it's legit.  The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves.  Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time.."
8792,This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
2307,"I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!

The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.

The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.

The service is attentive, but not intrusive.

An absolutely divine dine!"
4742,"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing."

thanks, scottsdale plaza resort!"
1735,"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really."

3339,"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass."

2435,"R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful. 

We will be going back!"
5107,"Seriously, if you're looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear, look no further."
3981,"I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location."
636,"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!"
508,"Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.
I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?"
7682,"This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service.

4640,"Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again."

7883,"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo."
8588,"C'mon! Fresh sandwich lunch for $3? The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches. Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee. Or is it no fee? Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas. Line moves super fast. Number pickup system is funky. My family packs these things to take home on the plane!"
2753,"WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.  

We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.

Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az."
6867,Love this store!  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didn't have.  Love their halloween section too.  It's my one stop shop for parties!
4889,"OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.

Admittedly; I was there once before ca. 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.

I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years. Would eat one again. The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again."
2962,"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."
9942,"Cork is an enigma.

What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.

The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more ""simple"" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?

The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.

Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!"
7169,"Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.  
I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.  You can find it in almost every item there.  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point.

Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.  Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale."
8422,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
2642,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
8442,"After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. ""Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad."" I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. ""Not bad I thought."" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.

The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as ""the bag was just opened, it's not possible"" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered ""wow"" and stepped out of the line.

The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?"
3016,"Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! 

but it was just perfect in ever way!!! 

They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... 
its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) 

my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! 

i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) 

WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... 

My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine 

we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... 

all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... 

i cannot wait to come back!"
228,"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!"
6461,Awesome staff. Great prices. Left feeling relaxed and refreshed. A must try.
4676,Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?
1626,"Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!

The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!"
3570,"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

6171,"I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.

the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.

5751,"This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley. Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water.

5239,"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."
6729,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.

Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck."

This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.

The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour. 

Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case. 

The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."
8829,"The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.
I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place."
4437,"2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Haven't made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ..."
5176,"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."

460,"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos."
3956,"Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family.  The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3.  No stage moms here, but rather a warm, friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios.  Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come.  Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters' confidence and love for dance!"
5934,"LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)"
5965,Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
6022,"::Sigh::

I love places like this.  It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect.  The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.  

Our server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction). I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.  Anyway... 

I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.  Both were great beverage choices.  I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.  I'd go with the original.

I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).  The atmosphere rocks, and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place."
724,"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.

On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's."
91,"So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.

Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between."
9002,Everything I have tried here is awesome! You can't go wrong with your choices! Service is ok. Could be better. Not very personable!
155,"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, it's an adventure!"". 

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)"
8867,"Definitely an awesome buffet.  Not your typical buffet stereotype.  Love the sushi.   Great variety of things to have.  If memory serves,  it was 19.99 when I was there.  I think a tad high, but someone mentioned 25 bucks, so maybe it's come down :-?  Sake is priced well, and the beers."
311,"The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)
This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)"
5170,"The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here."
1610,"We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.

As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!

We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!  

Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!"
7554,Recently moved from the East Coast. So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco. I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza. It's amazing. Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot.
6922,"I went to cowboy ciao for my birthday and was very pleased with it! My family typically likes to get a bunch of stuff and share so we started with a chopped salad, the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom appetizer. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were really flavorful and delicious, however, the chopped salad was the star of the night! It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast. I typically don't think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad. To finish it all off, the server brought me a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake on a plate that said happy birthday which was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food!"
6687,I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
365,"It's the place to be. 

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.

Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back."
1136,Best donuts I have ever had.
2995,"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said ""Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.""  I said, ""but it's on the internet with your address/web page""  and she said, ""yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu""  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces ""out-of-the-freezer-bag"" deep fried. 
 
 I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.  

A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers."
874,"We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.

If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot."
1747,"This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.
It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?
Yeah,I'm done here."
5261,Best damn Brownies on the planet (or close to it)! Words cannot explain how good they are. The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office! Way too much temptation.
5332,"I had a great experience.  Nice people.   My minnie poodle mix looked great and was happy when he came out!   Total bill: $43 + tip including cut, blow dry, ears,  toenails, anal glands and teeth.  Located in the Goodwill parking lot. 

This is my first dog, and my first experience with a groomer.  I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday, so they are busy.

I asked the front desk guy where the price/package list was.  He said they didn't really have a 'list' so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be.  He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me.  She quoted me $38 and I asked how much for teeth, she added on $5.  They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut (I said shave him, it's summer).  they asked about ears, tail, etc.

I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1.  I don't know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried.  When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head.  I can imagine he might have been a tough client, given that he is still puppy-hyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment.  He was blow dried for sure; His former curly hair was completely straight and soft.  

The shop is no frills.  No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside.  I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in, but I will go back again for sure.  

My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut.  (The first was done by a family member).  My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didn't recognize him when he came out!  He was soft, had a nice cut and smelled great, even his breath!"
6678,"If you are looking for a good vet, you have to read this.

If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT, a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced, then you really have to check out Dr. Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale. He is worth the trip.

I am so impressed by Dr. Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF. Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations. 

Since my last review, we have used them two more times. Once when Spencer got neutered, and once when he had to have his nails trimmed. I have to say I am so very impressed. I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing. Well, I can say confidently now that they most certainly are.

Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees. When he was done his procedure, I received a happy, completely alert dog back from them. His incision was minimal, the sutures were tight and he healed quickly. It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area. It was like nothing ever happened.

More recently, Spencer needed his nails trimmed, and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation, he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet. It is so bad that when I try to nicely, calmly approach him to trim his nails, he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day. Spencer was really abused and as a result, grooming is really difficult.

Well, I discussed this with the doctor's office and we decided that sedation (unfortunately) was our only option. His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done. Well, we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him. I am impressed, but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind. They really care about the animals they treat. 

They could have sedated him. It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them, but they didn't. They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to - and so they didn't. They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed. He left there, again and as usual, a happy, well taken care of dog. And we left there ecstatic! The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well - like he was their dog. I just can't say enough good things about this Veterinary Office. 

I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find - for humans and/or animals. So often, they just don't care about the patient. Well, not here. It appears to be their top priority. Dr. Howard is a very happy, well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way - right down to all of the people he hires (they are all equally happy and competent!). You will not be disappointed if you go here. They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can. They are truly exceptional. So if you need honest, competent & friendly care at very affordable prices, you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr. Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital. You will be in good hands! You will save money, and you won't be disappointed in the least.

They are truly exceptional, but that is the end result of really caring, really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing... And we love them for it!"
2790,John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
2300,"Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect."
7084,"My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently."
683,"I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. 

My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.

It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more."
4031,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  

I'm still waiting."
9667,"Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. 

For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)

I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often."
2453,"This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu. 

Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique. 

If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!"
1175,"eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions."
270,I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
5245,"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me....."
4062,"Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  I've been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend."
8137,"Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really.

I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.

But it's just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!"
1884,"The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.

I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-

Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor. 

Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. 

Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. 

We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.

Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.

The service we had was phenomenal.

The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!"
7703,"Absolutely unbelievable!!! This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe! But get there early as they close early and run out of food! It's so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I love French pastries, crepes and desserts! The macaroons melt in your mouth. I will be returning soon!"
5189,"This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  

I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend."
1309,"Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.

Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.

And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette)."
5886,"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)

Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.

I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever

We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.

For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!

Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.

Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.

For dessert we indulged on the ""Best Of Phoenix"" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! 

We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!

8097,"Romantic, quaint, amazing! We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals, and we were so happy we took their advice. We ordered a white pizza, a anti-pasta appetizer, and bottle of Chianti. We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere! Perfect date spot..."
2986,"Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going..."
7879,"My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum.  Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.

I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.

The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.

I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.

The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.

If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.  There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip."
9163,This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
8594,"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!"
7602,"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance"
6728,"A few weeks ago, I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October. I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was. He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out. He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do, which included taking out my furnace and installing a new ac/heat unit, pricing. etc.

Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed. Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous, especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule. (Thank you for your patience Crystal!!) Mike, the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins. Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed. He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat, made sure everything was in working order, sealed off the area in my now new closet (where the furnace was), made sure everything was cleaned up, and was just all around great. I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I don't know how they can do this in the summer.

Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical!"
1895,"Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong. 

High quality furniture and very low prices."
9700,"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town.  Their beans are the best I've had.  Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside.  This makes the best product.  All of you lucky enough to live in the state don't realize how lucky you are to have this treat!  I'm usually not an enchilada fan, but you have to try one here.

Some of the reviews comment on decor.  While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles, I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china.  And that salsa, I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles, but then I'd have to check it in my bag to go back home!"
7254,"Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!"
7579,"Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that ""only the donuts with holes"" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else. 
   Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business."
2662,"I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live."
3140,"My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!"
6481,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want. 

I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes! 

Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!"

5863,"GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY
With a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines).

4956,"I'll be charitable - this place sucks!

I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.

The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!

Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.

And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!

Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!"
5255,We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctor's office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.
183,"Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done."
3941,"If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.  Which I guess isnt saying much these days...  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.  

This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.

I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.  

Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit.

At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel."
9251,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho. 

I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)"

We got a to go order, perhaps that was mistake numero uno.  I got the nachos.. really, you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt! I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!  Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault. I will accept the blame. I really should have known better. 

Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp?? Bad Service! Lack of quality control....Really.. Really? You forgot the shimp? How do you do that.... Better question WHO DOES THAT?

Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had. 

Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other. We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.

Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.

""Last Chance"" is simply amazing, but only to those true bargain shopaholics. There are days when the store will be flourishing with dreamlike items fluttering all over the place, waiting to be picked up and finding a new home in your closet. Other times, you must dig deep, and then come out with a diamond in the rut.

I visited ""Last Chance"" today and fell in love all over again. I got a BCBG dress, three name brand tees, two casual dresses, eight hair bands, a adorable pair of earrings, FIVE purses and a pair of lace leggings for $39.00. And they all still had the Nordstrom tag on it!!!!

They had so many things on sale (in addition to their already low prices). To truely love ""Last Chance"", you must have an open mind and realize that this is not your typical department store, therefore it will not operate like one, so get over the kids, crowds and messes, it's Nordstrom stuff at below yardsale prices!! You must also be fashion and brand savvy.

""Uhh.. Darn diggity goodness mother of Betunia McGrittles, these scary looking boots with a devil pointy edge are $29.99, and they look like they have been tried on oh fooey pooey, that is just too garsh darn expensive Gurtude, And someone wrote their name, ""Jimmy Choo"" on it. Uhh, why are there so many  people ALL over the place, and grabbing shoes like crazy making a mess.. Oh goodness heaven no, this store is horrible.. Just like that ""Juicy Couture"" jumpsuit for $9.99 a piece up front, oh no another child making a mess, let's get out of here and go to Sears or JC Penny, they have such great elastic pants grandma jeans and they never have a mess there! I do not see why people like this place darn diggity.."" -Random ""Last Chance"" non-enthusiast.

""Last Chance"" tips..
(All ""Last Chancers"" will put a  hit on me after this, but I love my fellow yelpers oh so much lol)

*Arrive EARLY. Anytime after noon all the goods will most likey be gone and all the damaged/ugly stuff will be left. 

*WATCH YOUR CART! People will take you 25.00 pair of Coach wedges lol

*Don't make eye contact with anyone! Don't trust anyone! If you see a pair of Seven jeans for 14.99 DESCRETELY grab them and move on.. Any sense of alert will beckon a herd of jean hungry woman and you will get mobbed!

*Move QUICKLY, if you have to RUN! Especially if you are there right when they open, set your mind to what you want and RUN to that department. This will assure first dibs on the that section's finest.

*Don't start crap with ANYONE! It can get really ugly.. and there is a wall of pictures of ""banned"" people from ""Last Chance"" and that is no where you want to end up in for ANYONE!

The rest of the tips are too super insider to say aloud, sorry huns! but I will spill one super ""Last Chancer"" tip..Happy shopping! muaaah :)

*Look in the size 10-11 in woman shoes, that's where all the BEST shoes are ""hidden""  or ""stashed"" by other people who will be back later that day or had to go to the bathroom upstairs and didn't have anyone to hold their shoes. No woman really wears those sizes so they figure to just stash them there for a few minutes.. I cannot begin to describe the designer glories I have discovered stuffed behind a size 11 pair of Pumas..

8343,"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.

Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.

This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence."

9653,"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!"
1271,"Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go."
1122,"I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time."
3886,"I personally like this Fry's. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options."
9186,"Ii am addicted.  spectacular service and consistent, quality. food every time. i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint.  only once...they gave my takeout pizza to the wrong person....christine, the manager, very generously apologized, comped my new pizza, and bought me a glass of wine as i waited.  grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food.  every time."
7233,"Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.

1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. 
2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.
3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. 

I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now."
3489,"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

Good:
1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.
2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.
3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.
4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. 

Bad:
1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 
2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.
3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.

Ugly:
1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really ""ugly"".

Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit."
3505,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
1548,"This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. 

I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. 

This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office."
6023,"We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again."
672,"Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!"
4843,"Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware..."
6707,"All I can say is ""yum!"""
9256,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch! The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.  Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated! Go to this branch, you'll understand what I mean!"
9900,"Soft opening, so still working out the kinks. Food was deelish. 
Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasy
Honey chicken-a little sticky but so good
Teriyaki chicken-subtler than other places' teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender
""tootzi"" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly
Nice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc.
Will definitely be back."
5593,"These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.  
Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch."
6547,"Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try."
9265,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.

I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites:
cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy!
santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy!
cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious!
shrimp fajitas
shrimp tacos

And for dessert:
fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"""
8404,"Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.  He saved my day and completed everything same day.  Thank you Bruce!"
2358,"Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. 

Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. 

How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening."
8461,Best pasta I have ever had. Don't go there if you're looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.
2794,"We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now."
8335,"Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!"
8878,Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.  Quality cut and great people. These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.  No froo froo!  Russian not spoken there!
1596,"If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an ""endless"" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.

 In a word: perfecto.

Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona. 

But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.
 
Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey."
1110,"cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You"
9411,"I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it."
8712,"We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.

A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.

I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.

Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.

Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun."
1021,"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place! 

BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"
4849,"I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.

First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. 

The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. 

The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  

The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  

Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.

Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the ""chef's chef"". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!

The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant..."
3795,"After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego. 

Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers). 

Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags. Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere. Highly highly recommend."
2733,Good food
3854,Awesome!!!
2923,"I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  

For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.

The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.

I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar."
2219,Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
389,I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
2443,"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. 

The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! 

I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). 

I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. 

I highly recommend El Bravo."
4667,best in the valley
959,"Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc). 

When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping. 

If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go! If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more."
1121,"Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-))

Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19"

1) Miller High Life on draught and bottle.
2) Buckhunt (the lil orange gun has even been taped together-double buck bonus!)
3) Bowling videogame...god, I love these things
4) Indoor smoking lounge!!! With a large screen TV, two tables and a lot of pleather seating, the large fan won't mean much but WOW-exciting! There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar.
5) Well...even the womens' bathroom is pretty gnarly...which would normally subtract a star-but I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I won't touch it!

Other notes: all bartender, barbacks, security were extremely sweet and friendly; all other patrons were either pretty chill, excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation; tons of televisions everywhere; they had a lot of beers on tap-cheap too; this place is HUGE. In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each section-at times I found myself balancing precariously-and that is b/c I am a klutz-wasn't even drunk...ok, not that drunk. Most everyone had tats, black hair, laid back. This is def. not a scene-and I love that!"
9441,"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. 

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.

Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive."
4137,"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable. 

best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine. 

breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot."
2853,"My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out, so I got in touch with Brad.  He was very professional throughout the experience, and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.  Punctual, efficient, and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive, and his work is worth every penny!  The office looks brand new."
126,"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. 

Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches."
6537,"Just your typical warehouse club right?  I guess that depends on your definition of typical.  Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.  All you do is go in a pay for it.

They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.

In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know ""clearance"" section at each Sam's.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a ""1"".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.

They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.

My boys also love the cafe where they get their ""pizza and drink please.""  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though.

They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!

If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.  Their refund policy is really good as well."
477,I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
8384,"in addition to sucking, it's also expensive."
5415,"The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.  WARNING!!!  You will want to spend money!

On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept. store style, it is their selection that is amazing.  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.

One final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.  Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $2 back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!

Oh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew... He is a great help and honest as can be!"
3172,"Got to love the concept, coffee, art and a co-work space friendly for start-ups.  OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft.  The coffee is good, the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they don't harass you, I couldn't ask for more to get work done!"
6832,"Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one.

Always busy, and you'll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well.

Portions are huge, but no complaining because it's all delicious!"
1012,Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
7961,"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!

Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.

As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.

1303,Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
3079,"Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)"
4633,"Torn between review Fez Foodies, the periodic event that allows patrons to participate in sampling yet-to-be-added menu item and tweak them based on responses and the actual restaurant that hosts said event and providing a CenPho restaurant that combines innovative cuisine with ambiance and amazing service, I settled on the latter. Because without the brick-and-mortar there would be no former. 

So, tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you. The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful. The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree. Honestly, I look forward to returning and getting these items, because Fez actually takes customer input/suggestions and applies them. 

Fez is one of those locations where I've never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal. I'm fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people don't appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucket-loads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary. Tools. 

Not surprisingly, Thomas was a peach of a host. Forgive me if I seemed disinterested in conversation: we just returned from Rim Country and that experience killed my ass."
4163,"I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.  They close very early (4pm).

I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.  As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.   All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! 

 As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer."
7612,"This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food. 

Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.

Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood."
3889,love love love this place for a second i don't feel like i'm in fakville anymore.  Live music and a diverse crowd.  They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice!  Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe.  Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside!  Love that it's independent and staff is so lovely.  I would pay $10 for a latte just to support them!  Punch card too!
9999,"4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts""romantic"" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.."
7767,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
1159,"I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon."
2312,"OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon."
7160,"WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!"
9586,"This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here."
2374,"One of my most favorite coffee shops! Location for sure. Soooo cute here. Inside and out. The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment. Coffee is pretty darn good. Not the best, but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa..."

6471,"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.

Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.

Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home."
8596,"Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:

1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.

6965,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf! 

We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.

I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a ""Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter"" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! 

Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. 

Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone. 

If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!
I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their ""team trivia nights"" soon - sounds like a blast."

Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.

4781,"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it "" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back""."
7181,Fresh and delicious.
3579,"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. 

For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!

There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)

Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!"
7156,"We went to check out PNP for their 2 Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed!  Space 55 is the most charming space that I never would've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp!  The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us!  I'd heard of Comedy Improv, but Movie Improv?  I had no clue... 

Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H (our very own Phoenix yelpers) who did an incredible job on Saturday night.  Congrats again, PNP, on your 2 year anniversary!  I look forward to attending future performances for sure!"
9106,"Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen is a gem in the many pizza locations that can be found in the Phoenix area.  Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers, salads, organic and gluten-free pastas, and of course pizza and dessert!  One cannot go wrong with any of the categories of foods Picazzo's offers, but there are certainly favorites that can be ordered upon ones first visit.  

Picazzo's offers a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere upon entering their establishment.  One is greeted immediately by their hostess at the door and then you are seated promptly at one of their many tables (or the bar area if you prefer).  The atmosphere is roomy with their ample seating, and friendly upon entering.

One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls ($9.50).  Made with three meatballs with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, organic tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan, it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot. 

One can choose from one of their many pasta dishes or their pizza creations, or even create your own creation.  If going with one of their creations, I would recommend their ""Nonna's Favorite"" (gluten free) ($16.50, $21.00, $25.00).  This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic, Fontina and mozzarella cheeses, mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and basil. Melts right in your mouth and one can easy eat more than one expected! 

If even after all of this you still crave something sweet - One cannot go wrong with electing their ""Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie"" ($7.00).  This sinful combination includes two scoops of organic vanilla bean or coconut vanilla ice cream served with your choice of organic chocolate, chocolate mint, or chocolate raspberry sauce over a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie.  Oh wondrous dessert indeed!

Picazzo's will leave you most satisfied and delighted with all that is good.  With the finest ingredients, Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish.  Stop by Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen today for an unforgettable meal."
5550,"This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is.
I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.

- Roasted Corn Pizza
- Baked Wings
- Red Velvet Cake

2415,"I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too! 
After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!! 
We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous! 
Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! 
The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!
Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)... 
I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...
REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!"
9053,"Not only does this place get it's ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily! 

I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back. I've tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet. 

So far my favorite combo is the ""most popular"" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta.

Don't forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kid's size free!"
798,Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!
5133,"This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store. The produce is plentiful and fresh, they have Boars Head at the deli, and they have organic options. The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs. It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices."
4909,"Always great, fast and consistent!  The service is excellent, the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes.  It's nice to have the counter service so you don't have to wait to be waited on...because if I am at the mall I am there for serious business:)  If you like a home grown grilled cheese and some tomato soup or a salmon Cesar salad or even a gourmet pizza this is the place.  The brownie and the red velvet cake are hard to resist ...get both!"
2624,"Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.

The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.

Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.

1306,"In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon."
1943,Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
9465,"I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!"
926,"I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.  I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.  While I was in Anthem this week, I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.  By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra."
1754,"I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously ""cute""  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day."
9350,"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert."""
2595,"This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."
2271,"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.

7112,"The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.

Cons:
1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!
2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated
3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.
4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it
5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles
6) 80s style tube TV 
7) pink 80s decor
8) worn down bed with body dent in it
9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar
10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night
11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning.

1) location
2) staff smiles and says hi
3) cleaning staff does a good job"

2452,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
6984,"Awesome place.

I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. 
Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer? what?! Whaat? I had to take a picture of it. The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :p

My coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here. I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty. but everything else was great. spicy broccoli...
fat-fat cooked potatoes....
perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm..

but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this. 

In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character. The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly. 

Good memories here!"
6768,"I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby."
608,"Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)"
443,"Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!  

They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.  

They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.

The clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!"
3278,"Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!"
6541,"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate..."
500,"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.

Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.

Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.

Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night."
2394,"Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!  

Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!"
5475,"Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul."
1200,"I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.

The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place."
2439,"I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time, and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!"
4933,"SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!

My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD. 
They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.

They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family."
1235,"This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many ""Libras"" (Pounds) and you want them to make it ""Preparada"" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!"
9863,"Toasted subs at their best..   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.  And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal."
7668,"Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.    The staff was great and super friendly!  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!!  

Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades"
3316,"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! 

The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"
8810,"Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.  Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell, we will not be returning.  The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband, ""jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!"
299,"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? 

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

But the food was way way too ""greasy."" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there...."
983,"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. 
   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice."
86,"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around. 

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) 

Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. 

you will not be disappointed."
1045,"The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale. 

Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. 

The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.

148,"Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. ""bad service = bad review"""
4061,"We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house. We've never had a bad item here. It's a fun place to go and the food is great. We always order pizza which is consistently good. Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater. And the wings are always excellent. 

We've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming. It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in! Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza. The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door. You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.

We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever."
3105,"I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful."
3742,"I've played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US. We're lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard. This course stands out! Exemplary service, and the driving range is the best I've ever seen.

The course is tough. No country club rolls here. Hit it right or left and you're undoubtedly taking a drop, and a stroke.

Can't wait to get back for my next round!"

Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my 'hood. It's a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox. 

There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini: 

1. Bring cash. Cards aren't accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasn't worked in at least two years. 

2. Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. He's my neighbor. 

3. Don't piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and don't order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit. 

If you can't handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is."
1507,"Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN."
7047,"The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!"
2963,"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. 

Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. 

We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. 

We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) 

After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as ""cajun-style, but not overwhelming"". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. 

The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. 

Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.

One comment: The ""Branding"" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it ""Dominick's"" or ""Lincoln Avenue"", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)

 I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!"
3519,"Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food. Pearl is an exception to the rule. The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock. I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good. All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff. Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like. Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive. Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable. Overall great value and relaxed attitude."
2945,"Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer. If you want yours well done, ask. You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit, and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot."
8312,"I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style. 

I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. 

There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love..."
8695,"little known secret- the golf course bar!!!!  amazing margaritas and a super-cheap happy hour.  didn't mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing, either!  my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa."
1887,"I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it."
4708,"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.

Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).

As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.

I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.

Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that."
7897,"This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from, absolutely fantastic!

My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room. Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated. We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful.  We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed.  The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one. Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at.  We have since received the piece and could not be happier!"
1835,"YUM!

I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!"
9038,"Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients. 

I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me. 

As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.

And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But I'm not surprised."

5582,"I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop..."
2677,"My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance."
4030,"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star. 

I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner. 

Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. 

You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? 

Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.

But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring."
4241,"This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!

The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.

Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!

A must visit!"

My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and Waffles

Lo Lo's is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.  

There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please."
5620,"Love Bagel Nosh! The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious! I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte, but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing! ( I do realize it's no longer pumpkin season, I was just wishing I had some anyway) It can get busy on the weekend mornings, esp since the bike shop opened up next door, but I find it well worth the wait! (Oh, and fyi it closes at 2:30 - so get your coffee early!)"
2198,"Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again."
7005,"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.

I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me."
3652,"I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  ""It's good, I fixed it good"".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  ""I fixed it good"".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place."
445,"Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!"
5494,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour. 

They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines. 

What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.

Never, EVER again."
9978,"This is the place for a fabulos breakfast!! I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here. They are the best. I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas, pecans and hot syrup...yummmmy. They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good, Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait."
5815,"Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day. I've always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadn't been in a while. Put an order together w/ some co workers & called. I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER! I don't believe they did the last time I'd been there. Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c it's huge. I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be. I don't know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that I'd told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great."
3461,"I will make this real easy for you. 

Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor."
6617,"I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food."
6452,"I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.  

The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods."
4425,"I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.

Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!

Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!"
7583,"I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in. 

If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it."
9138,"I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...

Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  

If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.

P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!"
1060,"We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a ""tell"" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again."
2996,"Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!"
453,"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."
4184,"This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.

This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. 

The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. 

I will NOT be returning to this place......."
9075,"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)

I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either. 

I will be back. a lot :)"
6658,"I stopped by here last night after the Suns game. It was cheap and fast. Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted. It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. 

Oh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around."
4544,"I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great."
4940,Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.
1082,"omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food."
8285,If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.
8713,"Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere. Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money. The amazing reclining seats are worth it though. I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies! 
   Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!"
1611,"Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!"
8155,This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.
990,"I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.
  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy."
8805,"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  

Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.

They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc."
4539,"Cute, cozy, pleasant and very friendly service. That is really all I have to say about them. The food was oh so delicious! Little bite sized tacos. Service was fast and just perfect! They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards. Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant."
4842,"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.

Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.

The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. 

We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far."
862,"An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.

There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.

There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way."
7717,"Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...I'm sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b"
468,"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast."
2261,"They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai. 

If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!"
3609,"Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"
5709,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
8866,"OH MAHHH GOSH, what retards they have working here. Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes. They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed. Really? What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon??? And no, I don't care to upgrade my phone. I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!! Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you? NO."
3912,"When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  

First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  

My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.

It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!"
9358,"If you want Cheap go to Walmart! 

But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!"
284,Great service
6573,"The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark. It's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front. The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- although never while I've been there. There's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week. Other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch."
5467,"This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?

My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.

Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)"
803,"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did. 
They have a lunch menu as well."
2240,We loved this place.
7087,"I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.

As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as ""Mr. Crusty Baker"" (see photos).

The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a ""Burger Party Contact High"". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality."
7956,"What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!  
Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!"
1178,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
8111,"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."
1053,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there."
9504,"I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, she's worth the wait!  
Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  She's irreplaceable!"
4818,"I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing. Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal. I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships, but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day. Thanks!"
6477,"We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest."
5111,"5 BIG STARS

For service and quality of meal, restaurants really don't get any better than this. Multiple servers, dressed in NY black are constantly there for you.

This restaurant prides itself in using local products & blending them into traditional meals, ala Alice Waters, and they do an excellent job.

For starters, we had (are you ready?):
-""Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes, Fossil Creek Goat Cheese & Mascarpone Tart,"" including Buckwheat & Saguaro Seed Tart, Basil foamed from the garden, Black Ice, and Gila River Olive Oil; and
-""Pan Flashed White & Green Asparagus with Chanterelles & Cholla Buds,"" including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue, Desert Quail Egg (sunny side up), Red Currents and Aged Sherry.

And that was just the beginning! For dinner we had:
-""Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood, Dry Mole & Green Chile Sand,"" including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney, Truffle Frites, and Rutabaga Cobbler; and
-""Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole,"" including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel, QC Olives, Eggplant, Wild Mushrooms, Heirloom Tomatoes & Iitoi Onions.

Everything was exquisite!

This meal was to die for!

Any complaints at all? Well, yes, but very minor. This place is actually in a Sheraton, but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals.

And the decor? Not very good. It needs a serious MAKEOVER.  Wall-hangings, window treatments & carpeting aren't much.

So there you are..."
6621,"My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved. We went and fell in love with the place. The service, the food, the friendship. We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you. Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmother's.
                                   Dave A"
8585,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. 
Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!"
6503,"As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.  However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.  The food was less greasy than Filibertos.  My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.  They all tasted excellent.  My favorite was the carnitas burrito.  Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future."
6276,Hate long lines at the DMV?  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason? Then you should check out Desert Title Service.  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.  I will never visit the DMV unless I have to.
9446,"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience."
6819,"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life."
4011,"Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want. Small but worth it."
3878,"I took a road trip with the fellas to watch the LA Kings beat the Phoenix Coyotes @ the Jobing.com Arena and I must say our experience at this hotel far exceeded expectations!

Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys (3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge!), but the room was very nice, included a small refrigerator and microwave and was very comfortable!  Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Center/bars/restaurants/arena which was a HUGE plus!  At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely! 

We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having ""bed bugs"" and being dirty.  You won't have that problem staying here!  The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating!  That was probably the best part:  Friendly staff!  The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I've ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast!  And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it.  After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!  They had something for everyone, including a variety of cereals and  whatever you can think of for breakfast free of charge!  

So if you're planning on staying anywhere near the Westgate center/Phoenix stadium/Jobing.com arena this is the place to stay!  We will definitely be staying here again the next time I'm out in AZ for a game!"
2262,"Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here."
3539,"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1"
6820,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.
In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."
8487,Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(
3309,So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!
5124,"I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.  The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natcher's office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natcher's schedule within a couple hours of my call.  Dr. Natcher's is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.  As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete. She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.  I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.  I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.  I can't speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher."
6440,"Fantastic place to learn Krav Maga and workout. My two sons have been going to React Defense Systems, RDS, for years and they finally convinced me to go. I love it and it's too bad I didn't go earlier! 

The instructors and facility are top notch. As a beginner, the instructors made me feel welcome and motivated even though my skills were untrained. After two weeks, I can feel, see, and hear the difference. I love smacking the bag with sweaty fists and feet and seeing the sweat fly. 

If you are looking for intense conditioning, then RDS is the place. If you are looking for life saving skills, then RDS is still the place. Learn a great life skill, become fitter, and have fun. 

I agree with AZ Central: RDS is the best boxing/martial art facility in Arizona. 

In closing, I'd recommend RDS to anyone and I apologize to everyone for not being creative enough to think of something funny or flippant. 

Oh did I mention this is one of the few places in the world where parents and their kids can legally beat on each other and enjoy it?! When was the last time your son hit you? ;-)"
2869,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.
502,"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"
3479,"It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!!"
7951,"This speakeasy was kickass. The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great. The drive thru is an awesome touch. I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good. We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter. It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited. I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!"
8964,"Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.

The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.

Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.

Five stars.  Places don't get much better."
4582,"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.

I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!"
3420,"Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad. 

I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy. 

The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth. 

I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!"
7646,"5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.

They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!"
2105,"Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate. 

We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. 

Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.

We'll be back, and with more friends."
3028,"My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign "" Best Sandwich...."" Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12"" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market."
7022,"Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe."
8880,"Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge."
8117,"This place is great! A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff.

You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat, veggies and garnish you want. Then, mix a neat selection of sauces. Finally, watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone.

Everything comes out fresh, hot and delicious! Want a tip? Use the wax paper next to the chicken to ""stuff"" your bowl. Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price."
7174,"I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!"
6898,"I'd go back the next time I'm in town.  Its friendly in here.  My friends and I just went in here to peek but we were presented in glasses of rose.  It was good, so I checked their stores of champagne (I like it pink).  I should have bought a bottle but we were on our way to an interview or dinner."
3620,"I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago.  Once again we found ourselves needing some quick, delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again.  As before it was absolutely delicious.  The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant.  This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food.  Thank you Bertha's Cafe for not only being so accommodating, but also for having such wonderful food."
8015,"I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.

First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.

Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.

Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!

I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.

It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work."
7625,"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."
4350,My food was delicious and the waitress were nice! They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal. Spicy does mean spicy here though!
1751,"I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her..."
4505,"Open Range offers some damn-good home cooking. My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal. Not to mention that the portions are huge. 

I usually order the cobb salad. From a typical deli, I'd normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon. But if that were the case, I wouldn't be ordering the salad again and again. The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (I'm pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else, but it is GOOD. Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.) I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.

My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!

Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.

In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year. The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails. 

To make this long review short: if you're looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and you're in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner. You'll probably see my family and me chowing down too."
8659,"We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven.  The drive was worth it. 
Loved everything about this place from the service to the food! Definitely be back."
3636,"Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged! Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat! If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!"
3381,"I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.

I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. 

I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!"
1750,"Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place."
5761,"Wow! Food was great! But the service was even better!!! We got there early so we didn't have to wait a long time.  

Their computer system was down, so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers, they comped out lunch. So impressed with this place! And such a cool vibe!"
9660,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon.."
7099,"I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.

I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on."
1699,"Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate."
1565,"Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just ""so so.""  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment."
4249,"AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.

For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra ""tax""?

The theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here."
3527,"Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. 
I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."
7382,"Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'."
5525,"My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol. 
   We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:)

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!
I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)

Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!"
684,"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips."
3646,"I have long been a fan of AJ's and lucky for me, they didn't open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.

The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy. 

I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadn't touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but won't buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her. 

Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJ's right away for some iced tea!"
4333,"May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER"
3326,Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.
6052,"Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!

Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.

OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)

It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is."
260,The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
5238,"Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The ""Bacado"". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service.
Delicious."
7970,"THis place is great! I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time, so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can't get in soon enough quite often. So.. now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro. I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr. Brian and they love him. So if you need a good Chiro... go see these guys any day of the week. Try em you'll love em!"
521,"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. 
Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
1813,"Careful! You'll get addicted.

Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.

The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!"
6906,"Love massages and facials!

I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs."
8509,Chef Bianco does it again! The homemade pasta is unreal. You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all. I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice. You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.
1205,"I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us."
6351,"Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in.  Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.  After a unanimous ""Defnitely, it's awesome!"" amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my ""Is this place worth going to?"", we parked the car and walked on in.  This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!  Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).  It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.  It has become my new ""first stop"" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night...."
3142,"My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time. I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo. They firefly room is utterly transporting as well. Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon. I strongly recommend a strolling date here. Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free. Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower. Its free if you exit from the north side."
5955,"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."
3919,"Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.  We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.

The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing. I definitely recommend this place!"
9493,I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
9471,"Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!"
9059,"My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife. 

I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future."

6391,"I'm convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job.  I've been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother.  I fly 3X/year on the same flights.  The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse.  I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!  This rant is not about operations, security or delays.  It is about the customer service by pissed off employees.  My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened.  I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!  This old, cranky b#$%^ came by and said, ""what do you want?""  I said I would like to have a soda and a water.  She said you can only have one or the other.  I was so thirsty I asked for the water.  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!  She said, ""I told you that you could only have one""  and pushed the cart away.  Even the people around me were in shock.  The check in personal were equally as rude.  If you are watching the internet news, there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom!  I for one will never fly with them again."
4593,"Delish!!!!!! x 100!!

Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!"
229,"Great Mexican food. 
Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. 
Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish."
6634,I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
1908,"Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice."
1836,"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad."
7920,"SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN! The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday. No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.

The beginning is a bit dry. You're in the ""classroom"" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.

Once the hayride was over, the ""tour"" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.

In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.

After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my ""deal,"" we enjoyed them a lot.

Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.  Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too."
5763,"Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!

Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!"
6868,"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice."
9237,"An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs. 

Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!"
8075,"I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute! 

Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!

Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist."
3551,"This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!"
4756,"I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.

Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough. 
I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.

Always friendly.
Always clean.
Always awesome.

Yes, there is heaven."
9966,"I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago, and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in.  The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs.  If I ever have a question or concern, it is always promptly answered or dealt with.  Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door! It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience. :)


On another note, I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now.  My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body, and I could not be happier with the results! In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs. and I look and feel amazing! He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition, giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans.

I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it...

Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. 

I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  

It's one of my family's favorites!!!

5022,"I think that most of the negative reviews I've read about this Gold's gym really stem from people's own insecurities. I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members! I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals! 

I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...

Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me....

Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about?? Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... that's what gyms are for!!"
9040,"part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event."
946,"I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. 

Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air."
8761,"Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.

Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.

Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around."
6370,"I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best. On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening. The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes. The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street. Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list."
2041,"I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea."
8269,"Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good ""People Watching.""

Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour ""tapas"" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.

The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like ""meatless chili"" but you don't miss the meat.   

The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.

Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.

I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended."
2793,"The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since...
Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction."
4198,"Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY! 

Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store. We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels. Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well. The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.  

We're we're pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza. Hands down the best pizza we have ever had. The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth! 

Feels more like you have been invited to a friend's house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant. Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us)

While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place"
7550,"I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon. I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha... Blast? or something like that. We both loved them. While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste. 

The shop was really clean and nice and cool. I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with. They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games. I didn't go to look at it. I think there was music on but I can't remember.

The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there. You can't use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit. We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it. 

I can't say one bad thing about it. If I find something else on another visit I will update. As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba."
3341,"My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea"
8817,"I am OBSESSED with Ra.  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I don't know how I would get my fix when in different states.  I don't care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.  This place is THE best!

First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurant's best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmon's sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.  

Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great!

Oh and I can't forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling."
1260,"Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion."
5019,"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

Thank you Charlie!

Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!

btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment)."
7727,I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*
5128,"We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.  Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.  If you're in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place."
5607,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
1353,"My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.

Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.

And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.

These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.

Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point."
1650,"Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. 

As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed."
3936,"Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:

1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food.
2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list.
3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy.
4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.

The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza I've had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!"
7514,"Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay."
295,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"
9574,"This place is great!!! They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!! The food tastes great...don't forget to get a milkshake. It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!"
7926,"When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!"
3846,"My picks:
Derby Smash
Green Chili Risotto
Pan Seared Escolar
Sticky Buns

If you are looking for Arizona charm, this is the place. Every Arizona resident needs to experience this hidden gem.

Thanks Jacquie, Kristy & Tim for continuing to believe in this historic restaurant and landmark!"
4595,"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. 

I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. 

I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!"
1551,Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
1049,"I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there."
2275,"This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.

The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again. 

Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out..."
4463,"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."
2709,"Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.

Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my ""work attire.""  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.

Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!"
8268,"""MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER."" - Jules. Pulp Fiction.

I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California. 

It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)

Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.)
I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school). 
Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!"
4381,"This is my favorite place to go for Greek food. The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present.

The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service. I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive."
5888,"Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.

The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.

They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty."
2977,"I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities. 

Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!

I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate."
5699,"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.  

No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand.

Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...

So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?

I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.

We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.  

I would not hesitate to stay here again."
9857,"I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!"
6030,"Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.  

I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.  

Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine  

My Favs:

Sweet Corn Risotto

Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)

Alaskan King Salmon

Center Cut Filet Mignon

Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)

4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)  

Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)

I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.  

I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.  

Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012."
4744,"Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period! 

These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs.

Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!"
6102,"Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.

I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.

Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!"
1374,"They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.  

We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.

The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.

My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.

I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.

One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.

 Will definitely return."
2061,Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
3841,"burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmm

Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.

The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.  

I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.  

Local beers on tap, good price too.

Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!"
1124,"Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience."
2622,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.

If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon."
7672,"Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.  Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.  They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.

Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).  In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.

Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.  Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex."
7753,Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
1434,"How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?

The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out..."
831,"Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business! 

Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. 

I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!"
7548,Burger was delicious and fresh. Fries were well seasoned and crispy. Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation. Fun and good! Definitely coming back.
8717,"This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere! I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!

It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town. My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza. The crust is so crisp and perfect! As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon. Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.

Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!"
8642,"Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am). 
Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity."
1443,"Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ.
Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!

It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a ""mall"" restaurant. A MUST go!"
8502,"After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The ""soft opening"" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.   
If you're looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting, then Side Bar comes highly recommended."

9297,"Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten. I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+"
6847,"I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better."
1331,Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...
9178,The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!! One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
1773,"Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar."
1676,Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
8541,"One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server ""DK"" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something."
424,"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16"" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."
8299,"I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs. He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich. His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle. I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.

I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree). Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my ""second opinion"" quest led me to him. I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!

I definitely recommend selecting this practice. It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it. They also work well with insurance."

9346,"Mail Call is a full service shipping store. The owners are great-they are friendly and accommodating. I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair, much less than a larger place up in the airpark. They take care all of my local needs and get the job done. Kudos to Mail Call!"
3425,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan! 
Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed. 
The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi...
Go try and enjoy!"
2547,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
7698,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.

I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.

I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.

I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon."
1543,"Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.

The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.

The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece."
353,"Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. 

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. 

Lunch:

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting."
1695,"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol
Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!"
5650,The kids love panda express.  My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food. This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat.  And to be honest- I don't mind it either.
61,"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!
 If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some."
3078,"This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items, and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!"
3118,"We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix. 
        Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it."
4763,"Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! I've been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I can't wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!"

I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  

Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??

5355,"Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much. You would do much better by going to mcdonalds. This isn't the first time. I should quit giving this place chances. I'm disappointed every time. I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more. The staff is rarely friendly. They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen, a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods. The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile, and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?"
3733,"My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.

The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. 

Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.

We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!"
3512,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
2224,I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
7278,"This is a family owned local restaurant at it's best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area."

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down."
8244,"The people at this title company are as good as it gets.

the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise

9994,"Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training. 

But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year. 

I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean. 

Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!). 

I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!"
8463,"This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty."
9614,"Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat! The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food! If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!"
9014,"Top notch. He is now my go to barber. Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut. He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for. Can't go wrong with this guy. And what a cool place!"
6802,"These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!"
841,"Covet is an excellent clothing store.
In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop.

6522,"Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.

I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!"
7413,"We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.

Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. 

The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.

Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.

Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back."
3677,"Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler). 
I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison. 

This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!

We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest), busses that are ON TIME (DAILY, they are never on time. Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind. I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.

Etc, etc, etc.
But seriously, just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else."
3066,I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!
111,"As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.

As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!"
7580,"I am disabled with MS. The heat of summer about does me in, esp. in the car. Because of this, and because the best thing I've ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebody's ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I can't wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavana's Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesn't matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).
 
I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.

it is a great little find."

Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!

I'll definitely be returning :)"
3522,"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you don't see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it.

What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.

Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."

54,"Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...

Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.  

In the ghetto?  Check
Has sweet tea?  Check
Has no-nonsense, quick service?  Check
Ridiculously long wait?  Check
Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check

I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.

If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it..."
5623,"Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!"
5665,"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...

Just remember to bring cash"
1446,"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. 

When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new ""parents"" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. 

To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. 

While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? 

This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets."
1586,"I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion! 

When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.  

We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!"
8902,"I'm so happy this store is located so close to my house! Every time I come to this store I get great service. I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon - where Zombi has never had a bad experience. This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital, PetsHotel, Doggie Day Camp, Training services and at times has adoptions. My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience. I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up-to-date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice. The best part was that I didn't even have an appointment, I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait.

My only pet peeve (pun intended) is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long. However, it doesn't take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check-out experience AND they usually show up on their own, without customers complaining about only having one cashier. Bonus!"
8303,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu. 

 For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate.

 From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.

 At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.

 At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and I'll finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half.""

 I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it. 

 Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention. Smooth.

 That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying. 

 What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me."
7307,"What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness."

3478,"Well, what a pleasant surprise!  I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!  Congrats Dave and Payton!"

9173,"I'm not a big ""organic"" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.

Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.

As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!"
6253,"Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's. 

OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!

JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!"

I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.

Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.

I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.

It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.  We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   I've never been disappointed.

Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table...."
9201,"My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.

We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.

Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!

We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.

For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.

Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone
filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!! 

The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood."
9712,"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended"
2369,"I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead."
7045,"I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back."
7359,I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!
9210,We ordered seabass and ribs. Both excellent choices. Service very good. Ambiance was unexpected. Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees. Used restaurant.com coupon. Great deal.
5285,So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!
5136,"This is Mesa's best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my family's favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley. 

Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!

I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy. 

If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!

Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so it's great for those who can't decide between breakfast or lunch!"
474,"Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! 

Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. 

Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge ""by the glass"" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  

The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! 

My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!"
7719,"We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often. I love their food, the service, and also the atmosphere. My favorite's are the bun dishes, I always order the no. 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend. Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends, mine have always enjoyed the experience."
74,"I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )"
609,Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.
8153,"Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible. Then I'd never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!

I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!

I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.

Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety."

6901,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful it's easy to loose the trail on that side too. 
Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top. 
Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."
5420,"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"
3342,"HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!   What a sexy course this is.   This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!    Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?  It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.  A real private club feel.

As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!   No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.   Don't be afraid to lay up.  :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer... 

Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.   The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.  Nice rough, but not too tall.   A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.   The greens were also perfect.   Nice and fast, and TRUE!

Ok, I'm done gushing about this course...   Give it a shot, you won't regret it."
4335,"This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo!

I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience. 

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!

Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!"

1660,Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.
8452,Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.
2881,"How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.  

I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...

Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this - 

Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)"

4012,"Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!"
6907,"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!

This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. 

The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!

i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!"
9280,"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!"
4670,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
6219,"Great service! Great Value! Best in the valley hands down!!!! 

I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here, from my 8th grade promotion dress, my HS prom dress, my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here! 

Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well!!"
6041,"So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere."
9547,"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  

We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here

I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!"
1923,I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
8653,"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). 

P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.

P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match."

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?"
3958,"Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. 
So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. 

I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a ""Dirty Chai."" This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. 

Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. 
Press goes as far as to have a ""dog friendly"" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. 

I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area. 

By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines. 

Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice."
2416,"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.

I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.

We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.

I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare."
4751,"I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where ""shifty people"" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )"
2344,"I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the ""S"" coffee store.  

One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine."
3173,"I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them."
5250,"We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer."
6978,"In short - Jen rocks!

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.

I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future."
6372,"This place hits everything on my ""it's Awesome"" list. 
First off it's a family run little place.
Second it's in a hole in the wall area.
Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house. 
Fourtherly it is awesome

We were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?
If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and 
this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time.

We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. 

I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.

Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.

After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream."
8143,"Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors..."
8906,"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!

The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area."
8177,Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
4040,"I spent almost 2 years searching for a good nail salon in the North Scottsdale area and I will never go anywhere else again.  It is very clean, the girls are very nice, and they always do a really good job on my nails.  They are upfront about their pedicure prices - they hand you a price sheet that tells you exactly what you get for each upgrade - instead of pressuring you into getting something better and then upcharging you.  I think their prices are super reasonable as well.  For the best pedicure and a french gel manicure I pay $70.  I usually make appointments (Sunday mornings are nicely uncrowded), but I've also walked in and been taken fairly quickly.  I love this place and will recommend it to anyone who asks!"
4149,"All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!  

My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm.

The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :) 

The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.  

BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS! 

Even if you don't like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  It's a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!"
31,Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
5473,I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!
2563,"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top."
1514,Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
7027,"AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour."
8787,This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.  They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.  She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.
2867,"I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience. 
The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!

Some are saying it's too expensive? I think it's worth it."
8686,"The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.  I really don't have to say anymore."
5872,"We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience."
4179,Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
4784,"Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more. The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.  The Margarita's flavor should be praised. And the staff is top notch.  This is just what Chandler needed.  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  You'll thank me later.  I can't wait to go back."

7354,"When a man falls in love, it's a special thing. Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening. Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul. 

It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.

Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.

I heard all the hype...""best pizza in the country"", ""Oprah says it's the best"", ""The Food Network hypes it up"", ""Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus"". Ok, I made up the last one.

My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? 

Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. 

Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.

I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. 

Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. 

We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.

The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.

We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.

The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .
All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. 

The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. 

The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. 

Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!

Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.

Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.

Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.

Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.

8864,"Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  

The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy."
9149,"The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA. Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix. I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open. He certainly can't  make much money at this location. It's financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate. This just shows Dan Harkin's commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ. 

Thanks Dan!"
170,"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse."
2409,"Been here twice. First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup. All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of. I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again, they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said. It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!) If you have car problems, need a check up, or need a second opinion, they won't steer you wrong (pun intended)."
5612,Love Love Love it. The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce. You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy. Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals. Then they have a punch card program as well. My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.
7840,"It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.

If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! 

And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously."
6016,"A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.  
With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.

3457,"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).

I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies."
4642,"As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!"
1509,"One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire ""patio"" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids."
894,"I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!

Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!

There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!

This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)

Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)"
5926,"Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.

When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)"

for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. 

the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. 

i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. 
my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful.

I happened to find this place just on a whim....I was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities, and it occured to me 'maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix?'  Sure enough, there is!! (thanks yelp!) and she's GOOD!!!! 

Angela is as sweet as her candy is! She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier! She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate. You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CAN'T. WAIT! I hope I'm the first to order that batch!! Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes. 

The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!! THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT! She said normally it's by appointment only (I was not) but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways (yay!) However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice... (can't wait to do this!!)

Needless to say, this made my day...no, like, my week! SO excited to have a real, gourmet chocolatier right in my own neck of the woods! Woo hoo!!"
3965,"I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee."
5144,I love this theater!! it's 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly. I believe that the have child care if you have any. also lot's of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ Norterra.
6789,"I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour. His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Frank's life. I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.  
Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like you're seeing things through FLW's eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.  This is not to be missed!"
5383,"Have you not tried Which Wich yet? Do it. 

Buffalo chicken= hands down, my favorite sandwich ever in the world. I can't wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day. 

I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.  I now prefer to hit up the AJ's next door for cheap tea and salad bar (healthier, obviously) but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJ's only to instead go over to Which Wich... it's seriously delicious stuff. My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich (probably has a cooler name than that) and my backup fave is the chicken pesto (be sure to add bacon.) Always- and I do mean ALWAYS- get your sandwich toasted. 

Trust me. I'm a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches."
3589,"Half the fun is the wait.....If you are going to go, you may as well get into it. We get into it, at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine. L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings. I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall. Just kissing, but hot, if you lose earrings.

We went twice once alone, and the 2nd time with her sons and friends. We ordered every pizza imaginable. It seems almost every high end pizza now, is brick oven and more about the crust. I like everyone else will mention, I am from the East Coast and know pizza. Best in the United States, we have several that are at that level. You can flip a coin on which one is better."
8479,"The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!"
8809,"I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.

Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response."
8183,"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law."
3696,"The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night. We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable. After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers. 

We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked.

The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after. 

I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect."
8176,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.
6627,"We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charleston's we thought to be a manager (see review).  The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.  
Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.  Great job, Chris and team!  We look forward to dining at Charleston's with you again soon."
8702,"I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again."
8821,"What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes."
6519,"I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. 


When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? 


The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. 


The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. 
I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! 

In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!"
3384,"Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again."
2910,"i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours."
8146,"YOWZA! I love this place. I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year. I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch. The food was pretty good, but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives! This was music to my ears when they told me they had them. I have been looking everywhere, checking every grocery store, gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu! Oh and expect a little off roading, the parking lot is loose gravel :)"

9435,"Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart. We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused. I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer."
4441,Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left
6660,"Great sports bar!  Shows most UFC, Boxing and WWE pay per views.  Friendly staff, good food....  draft beer selection could be a little better, but other than that, one of my favorite local pubs."

Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us."
7765,I absolutely love this sub shop! Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich! I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it! Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer! MUST GO!

3623,"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.

Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.

When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).

When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.

The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.

Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.

Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.

Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.

P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel."
6166,"You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that. They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!), and, yes, great pizza. There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd. And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!"
6232,"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.

If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the ""other"" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.

If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.

Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."
3134,"The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!"
2047,"I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!"
6180,"Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it."
3946,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

5316,"I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.  

If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go. 

Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk)."
9827,Staff was quick and efficient. Food was delicious.
334,"As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!"
3879,"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus. 

The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.  

We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents."
9758,"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers.

Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK?

Holy MOLY what do they put in those things?

1947,"ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!"
7264,Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!
7318,"I have eaten here several times before...and I don't think I have ever left upset,  I've always enjoyed my meals, but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses!  

I was with a group of four other girls.  We all started off with the amuse.  It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast.  It was really good.  Next we had our choice out of four starters...I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop.  So beautiful!  Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin.  It melted in my mouth...It was perfectly cooked.  The only bad thing is that I wanted more! 
 
Finally, you get to chose from four desserts.  I don't like sweets, so I always bring it home to the kids.  But, they are so beautiful!
 
Now for the price...my meal was only $13 for everything!  It doesn't get any better than that.  I also ordered the orangecello for an extra $3.  Well worth it!

Only sad part is that we were the only table there...Makes me sad!  Everyone is missing out.

Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards!"
5307,"If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it."
2749,"Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here!
Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat).
Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.
Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz. 
Excited to go back and try some more pizza!"
4443,"I have been going here for years. I love the ""Hong Kong"" style pan fried crispy noodles!"
536,"Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service.

8772,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!

If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour."
5827,These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!
6775,"Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally! She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country. She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded. She's been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness.

Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you. Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough. Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, she's knows things to cover that we had not thought of! She's very professional and is licensed and insured. 

Your animals will thank you!"
64,Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!
2713,"Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. 

I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it! 

Bon Appetite!"
5213,Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
1474,The best bar in town.
3593,Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though
618,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. 

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny."
3401,"I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again."
4136,"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've ""cheated"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. 

Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. 

I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment."
12,"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  

The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4."
3921,Great service
2592,"We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix."
4638,Excellent! I love this place!
9611,"Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever."
4175,"Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there."
945,Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
7334,"The best Gelato ever...EVER!!!  Yeah I said it.  What?  Seriously, the best customer service I've experienced since the '70s.  By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from.  My favorites are the dark chocolate, salted caramel, peach champagne, and black cherry.  We've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time.  My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers.  If your looking for your next vice, check this place out!"
4847,"Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it."
3753,"I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. 

Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has ""Chicken & Waffles"" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.

Damn."
9941,"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much."
7831,"Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.

I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left. 

Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake."
90,"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...

Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...

I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)"
8374,"We made a last minute decision to go out on New Year's Eve.  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!"
2073,"Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto ""sandwich"", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!"
9241,"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants."
5877,"My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said, ""I've just had the best donuts I've ever eaten"". Me, being a pastry lover, had to give it a try. We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had, they were awesome! The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go, I probably would have never gone in. The donuts were soft and fresh, the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite, and they were also reasonably priced. We live in ahwatukee so it's a little out of our way, but we will definitely be coming here again!"
8974,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!

On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!

First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors. 

We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled."
7188,"Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..

NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!"
476,"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love..."
2597,"First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back."
5085,"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back."
6702,"Most livable city my eye!
Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.

Avoid at all cost."
1580,"Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service.
Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility.
All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.  
The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!"
2046,"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. 

Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable."
4016,"I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night.  I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all.  I love that!

We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.  The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.  

I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one.  Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!"
1666,"Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me ""we have signs everywhere."" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear."
7213,"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. 

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. 

Spend your hard earned money somewhere else"
707,"not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you."
9019,"This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos ""Lunch With Stew"". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar."

We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.  I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.  It's amazing, delicious, and very very unique."
2686,Loved it! Best French toast ever!
1481,"Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.

That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).

It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier."
4786,"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performance's then I would recommend Coffee Talk."
488,"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. 

as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. 

awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.

8387,"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!

Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice."

This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff."
3124,"Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful. 

No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.

A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really ""date night"" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks. 

You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.

The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?

Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin."
459,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
6055,"Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.  This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland.
Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition.
And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.
Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.
He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!
With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.  
It will be an amazing experience!!
Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous.
If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!"
9688,Yummy!

1226,"Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.

This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)

It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.

This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.

Considering this is the ""Biltmore"" location... huge disappointment. Fact."
4709,"I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.  If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's."
6684,"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? 

Ugh."
9148,"Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).

The concept of this place is killer."
7090,"True fine dining has come to the Valley.

If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.

The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.

The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.

But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.

We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.

The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.

If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all."
6169,"Believe the hype. That's all I can say. 

This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds."
8797,"I cannot believe I am about to say this:
AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.

For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.

I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  

OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!

This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!"

6397,Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
9947,LOVE Five Guys!
7021,"Don't usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment.
The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite."
1949,"Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.

On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion."
2902,"Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.  
1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.
2. NO BAG FEES.  
3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.
4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it.
5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants."
7535,"this place is so darn cute!  You might miss it if you are driving too fast.  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!"
4041,I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.
9987,"The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I don't know what else to say."
6571,"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too.
They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further. 
We miss you Los Taquitos....."
5058,"Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town.

3994,"Excellent place.  I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy.  The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want.  I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place. 

The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are."

i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it.

the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!"
9378,"I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.  Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.  Finally, I found Robert.  

He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood.

The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.  His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didn't want to go back to the real world.  

He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didn't plan ahead with stopping for cash.  

I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!"
1789,"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. 

We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. 

The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy. 

Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free..."
2811,"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry. 

I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. 

Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. 

The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange. 

I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar."

5037,My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
7962,"My wife and I went to Harris Dental for a few years when we lived in Scottsdale.  We moved out of town in 2009 but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from Dr. Joe Harris (who had come highly recommended from our Austin, TX dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research).  Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff.  So it wasn't really too surprising that we received a call from Harris Dental a few days ago - more than three years after we moved away - asking for permission to archive our dental x-rays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account.  Who does that?"
373,"oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.

well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.

so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?

i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.

can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?"
2780,"We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries. 

We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice. 

My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger."
710,"I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!"
2353,"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. 



As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!"
610,"Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.

With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what? 

Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station."
5371,"I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been

THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!

I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:

1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!

2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.

3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.

Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!"
4291,"""If you buy half a duck, you don't get to pick which duck.""

I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides. 

Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live. 

I don't know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called ""zhou"" or ""jook,"" and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.  

They're also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of. 

Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world. 

Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if you've had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise it's just about as close as you can get. 

If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you can't beat Hope Kee. 

Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and you'll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from. 

If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup."
8850,"Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+!  The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again."

3351,"I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...

Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.  

For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.  

If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.

I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!"
6414,"I have visited a few nail spas in Scottsdale and I like this one the best. ;)  They do the best work and they don't rush.  The environment is clean and well decorated.  They don't try to pressure you to get little designs on your nails. (At least, from my experience). If you want to chat, they'll chat. If you want to zone out and enjoy your pedicure, they'll let you. Just try to book your appointment in advance. They have availability for walk-ins sometimes, but your best bet is to secure your own spot."
2179,"Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and ""owner"" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!"

154,"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly."

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

THUMBS WAY UP!!!"
4196,"This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their ""Dirty Horchata"" or ""Espresso Excellente"" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time."
4377,"Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away."
7591,"Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect! 

The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99."
8725,"wow. this place is a gem.  highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine. 

visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.  

as for food, our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.  we all enjoyed all of it, i especially recommend the fig chutney, that was absolutely amazing.  from the sandwiches, the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.  overall, everything was very good and the service was great. 

as for the wine, great selection. the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like. in fact, i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.  if you're a wino like me, you'll love this place.  

as for the ambiance, they nailed it.  awesome patio and great decor.  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable. very chill spot. 

ps. check out the door to their wine cellar, i want that in my house. it's gorgeous."
9810,"I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!"
5273,"Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....  

Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...

Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!  

If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area.."
8201,"Fantastic meal.     Fantastic experience.     

I am a vegetarian.    I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing.    I don't just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets....that sort of thing.    Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special.  VERY special. 

Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn.    I dined there with my son and daughter-in-law...both truly expert cooks...more knowledgeable than I.     

All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal.    We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine.     I got the vegetarian...they got the carnivore (or ominvore or whatever they call it!).     Truthfully, labels are irrelevant.      It's all in the taste...and the tastes are sublime!

I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate.      Theirs were similar but each a little different.      More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors.      

The most impressive thing:   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations .     That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable.

The setting is beautiful.     The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well.

Our only criticism (and it is minor)  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability.    There is so much wonderful local fruit (used in other courses, I might add!)...perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely...I'm sure the chefs' creativity can conjure more ideas than I!

That said, I will return!    As often as possible!    Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community...easy to get to from any part of the Valley...no excuses, folks!...Go!"
7955,"Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature ""fry-pieces"",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!"
5890,"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!

1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...

2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!

oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have."
3434,"I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!

Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.

Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)"
3025,Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
8443,"I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street."
354,"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.

Ok, I'll wait.

Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!

We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.

Awesome place!"
2837,"I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.

My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free."
9319,"HA HAHAHAHAHA! 
""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.
now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.
opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.

the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).

i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.

anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave."
8327,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
2146,"Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place."
2226,"Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.

4445,"I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!  I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!  

He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman.

I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!"
3631,"Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. 

I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!"
5659,"Bad ass, just like the name.  I've heard that this facility doesn't have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  It's definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, it's a great deal."
4570,"I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive..."
9087,Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!
9757,"Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!"
1589,This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
4647,"I love this place!!! The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce. They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot. They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce. It has to be a mixture of ketchup, mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out. No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it. Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side. After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it. I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options. The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start. Hopefully they aren't there anymore. Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did. The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in. He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home. I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich. I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too. Good thing I got the fries! I would highly recommend this place. If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home. If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people. I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair. So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode!"
5113,"Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.

My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.

The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!!

I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"""
3999,"TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!"
4951,"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the ""main"" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.

$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.

Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!"
4096,"We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.

When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.

Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.

When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.

The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.

Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else."
5434,"These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat! 

Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!! 

I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties."
626,"Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!

Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!"
3226,"If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!"
1391,"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes."
9934,"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didn't love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really can't go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing! 

Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Don't be afraid to split a dish with a loved one."
7906,"This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten. The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in. sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing. It could easily be shared. The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade. We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda. To top it off the prices are amazing! This is our first time here but we are hooked. We would love to see this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, DDDinfo@mac.com, so if you love it here, nominate it!"
8688,"I'd love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!!

In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu.

There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if you're ballin on a budget.  

Everything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"
9640,"Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.

I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie."
4120,"I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.  Very happy with the service.  Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut."
479,This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
8709,"One of my fav sushi places in the Valley.  Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like.  Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive.  Some of my favorites include the spicy shrimp/crab roll, Phoenix roll, and their squid salad.  Plus - you can't beat the Vegas roll - $1.50 for 3 pieces? It's a steal!  Definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the Valley!"
5506,"Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!

The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!

Definitely worth the money!"

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"
6528,"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning."
2625,"How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a ""pub"", it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.

Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.

Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's."
7757,"UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!"
2678,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

1497,"Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!"
5783,"The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.

The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.

There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique."
8291,"Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.

*** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!"
5244,Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.
1926,Great food. Great ambiance. Great for a night date on the patio. I can't wait to go again.
8517,"This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!"
6342,"I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.

I strongly recommend this cafe!!!

Donkey-"
119,"Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along."
8950,"Great service, atmosphere and of course great food. My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner. We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served ""dinners"" of course he stated 10:00pm ""OOPS"". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and it's staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!!"
5157,"What a find.  In a strip mall nestled between a bank, clothing stores and overnight shipping is Giuseppe's.  A family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go.  This reminds me of countless small mom and pop's back in The City.  The staff is friendly, the portions sizable and the check small to medium.  In fact, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before.  Whether on a date, or with the family, I've never had a bad experience in the dozens of times I've been there.  From the veal parmagian (sp?) to the eggplant, from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals... mama mia.  It is a small venue, with very limited outdoors seating during good weather.  And the locals know about it, so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday.  The salads and appetizers are delicious as well... If this restaurant had been in Spinal Tap, it would get ""an eleven""..."
6682,Best in town!!
2512,"The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back."
8780,"Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work, hence due to its location + general fabulousness, it has become a regular spot for happy hour.

Here's What we LOVE about Fez:
-Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)
-Kisra and Hummus!
-The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: ""Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?""  She said, ""I totally know what you mean, no this one is good.""-and she was right!)
-Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)
-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm
-The friendly service
-The close proximity to light rail

Here's what we don't like as much:
-The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)
-When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)

Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix."
881,"I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!"
7439,"My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!"
3621,"Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the ""cock"" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.

The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.

Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic."
3337,"I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be ""New school"" or ""Traditional""   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating....
I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family."
3692,"Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for ""account inactivity"" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.

It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business. 

Account closed."
5225,"I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!"
8768,"I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay."
8207,"Had some amazing cuisine at Milagro's. The chef is truly an innovative genius. Our food was so unique and delicious. Plus, the weather was so nice that we sat out on their beautiful patio and watched the sunset on the purple mountains. I highly recommend the PB & J appetizer. It's nothing you have ever had before I can assure you. I would also highly recommend the swordfish dish and tacos."
6376,They have a mechanical bull.  Need I say more?
3902,"The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order."
1342,"Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.  

Hooray for pleasing the parents!!"
5840,"I recommend making OpenTable reservations, as this place is small. 
I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food. Margaret (sp) was a great server.

I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible].

The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux

I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent. I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry.
My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good. She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish.

For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum."
7609,"Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous."
7406,Excellent service and great quality.  I will always bring my alterations here.  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!
379,"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the ""boneless buffalo wings"" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu ""the Wendy's pickle sandwich"" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is ""the big WAC"" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!"
3027,"I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when I'm in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous. The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think it's a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes. The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit. I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost. The staff are pretty attentive.  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush. I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12."
3315,"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! 

The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)"
3126,"Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.

And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip."
333,"I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  

In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.

My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it."
2801,"Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed."
9843,"As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.

By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. 

I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.

They listened.
They created.
They named. (after me!!!)

We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!

So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.

I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too."
2691,"Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good"
2048,"Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection."
6786,"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.

I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door. 

I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!"
7874,"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- that's how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is. The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but it's there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3! Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone. I don't even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once. We go out of our way to go there just for that. This place is never that busy which I don't understand. Oh, and another plus, it's not the Tween's hangout on Friday nights. I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business.

You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS. No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you don't have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining."
8328,"This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately."
9623,"This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study.  The interior design, water fall, glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown. 

The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city.  Quick Tip: It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building."
122,"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.  

Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.  

Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm."
8660,"This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!"
8086,"Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?  That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious! 

I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.

Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the ""call"" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of ""The Habit"": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!  

Great burger.  Next time I'll get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!"
5280,"A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious!

They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.

Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment!

Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)"
5339,"Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. 

I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."
8208,"Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision."
1455,"I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.

She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone."
2404,"I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more..."
6513,"The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!

Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...

don't bother with this place."
3905,"The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale. I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces. they cook it up right in front of you. you can stuff your bowl as much as you can. don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents. it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still. The one in tempe was awesome as well. I love this place. I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that???"
2926,"These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!"
6508,Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx. And then there's the Pazookie...
390,"RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!"
4859,"AAAAMAZING.
They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs.
They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!"
6018,"Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time."
9981,"We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!

I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.

Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  

Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!"
8947,"I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil.  I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.  They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.

Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.  Try their food, such as the sandwiches.  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.  The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad."
9590,Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.
6853,"I am in love with this place. Everything is delicious. I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup. The portion size is perfect for lunch. They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread, which is perfect since I can't ever make up my mind. Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent."
9851,"If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food. 

I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.

The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named ""Climax."" Gross and just distasteful.  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming. 

Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi."
8332,I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure. I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were. I appreciate all the time and help they gave me. The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are. AMAZING Dentists!!! My family has a new dentist. Thank you!!!
8532,"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!"
7170,"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices."

6662,good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.
136,"Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS."
2290,"!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!

My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!

Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!

Here's what we had:

~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.

~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado, 

~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese."
7286,BBQ Chicken plate is excellent! My wife says that the half order is fine. Usually take orders to go and food is ready on-time! We eat here on a monthly basis.
5973,"This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.

I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant."
668,The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
2863,"Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try."
3966,"Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable.
I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms!
I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.

While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in."
7478,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.

I have to assume it's called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more."
9065,"EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA!!!!! 

A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend. We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. 

My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. 

After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! 

After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!

All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!

Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! 

I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a ""Thank You"" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit! A 5-star spa, indeed!"
5893,"Go here if you live in AZ.  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.  

I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child.  Might want to get a babysitter for this one."
7255,"So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!"
9826,"I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area."
9387,"By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal ""taco shop"", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum."
3231,"I've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and it's free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product I'm loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesn't clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when you're first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want."
3093,"I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was. I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom. Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great. I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others. I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day. This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!"
3107,"I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer. 

If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:

Appetizer: Calimari
Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken 
Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie

FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations."
8493,"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."
1920,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!"
9216,super great neighborhood bookstore. it's local and not owned by the man. jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.  They have new and used book and something is always on sale. It's attached to wild flower and next to macs.
3720,"This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession."
8505,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.  

We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.

My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.

I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.

We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.

The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.

3832,I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!
3805,"Wow this place is great. The whole atmosphere is unique. Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea. Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane."
9199,"was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website.

ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist. his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth. then he left, saying only ""hmmph"". he had a beach house in the cayman islands.

dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel!

he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional. he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care. i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness. we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party!

so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man.
p.s. he's not bald, doesn't have long nose hairs or a big belly, and his breath doesn't stink."
1914,"Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!"
6845,"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
I can't recommend this place enough!"
3184,"As a regular shopper of Last Chance, I must equally love The Rack. I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up. 

At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full. I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here. They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though. Last week I found the greatest find! I found the best pea coat ever! It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place. The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off. Score! Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter. Haha 

Check them out. The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn't. There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well. :-)"
6388,"The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands."
1011,"This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.  

Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.  

Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.  

We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense."
0,"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had.

Anyway, I can't wait to go back!"
6101,"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. I've never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they don't even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast!

We had great time!
yow, bill

PS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkey's sake, get a clue!"
8614,"I am very happy to say that Angela's truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood. I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor. When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor. (Tears in my eyes...) My darling, have no fear, there are people up here who understand flavor, quality and most importantly: Great Chocolate! My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait! Bravo mon ami!"
7784,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.

This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).

I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.

If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."
2352,"Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.

Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.

Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts. 

My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it. 

They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust."
4950,"This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything. I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, there's a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts. It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long. I see it as a small price for Macy's quality at a Walmart price."
3084,"Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!"
410,"I have been here many times, pretty much can't go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly."
8027,Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
1202,"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops."
3120,"Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG."
3569,"This place is great! Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road. 
...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!

...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!"
4431,"I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.

I need to come back and get the pizza!"
2759,Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!
4522,"I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.  Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries."
5814,"I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.

grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say"
1833,Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!
3302,"No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun ""home"" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously."
7667,"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best."
2550,"Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.

So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  

The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.

Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.

Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity."
3216,"I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!"
7549,"Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!

Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!

HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).

Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?

I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!! 

To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!

Yummy!!"
3069,I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
5754,I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
5723,"I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever. 
A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly."
9642,"This is my favorite fine dining in town.  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!  Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!  If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended, just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat, not allowed!"
9903,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery!

Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts. 

I am always upset when I visit and I can't stop by this gallery-and don't miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration.

Splleeeendid."
8140,How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.
907,"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.

 "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
4559,"Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200!

They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place.

From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here.

One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks."
8188,"Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. 
Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. 
Orange juice was fresh and tasty. 
Eggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. 
The setting was the star of this breakfast!
I would recommend ! You won't be sorry !"
7189,"I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people."
7885,"My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond's visit and while I couldn't do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th.

The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great! Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out."
9818,"Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda. 

Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk. 

The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?

The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. 

They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse. 

Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home."
991,"Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, ""I need to stop there."" Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!"
1466,"Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here."
5062,"I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.

I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!"
3614,Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
2568,Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
4799,"Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis! They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven! Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house! Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry. The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good. Yum!!"
180,"Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say ""it's organic, don't panic"".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!"
164,"Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!"
6000,"I take the light-rail downtown sometimes just to go here. I walked in the first time to a bustling, energetic, singing, cheering crowd and thought, ""where the H am I??"" I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement. Food is decent for a bar, great beer, great local music (it's the first time I saw The Waters). Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this."
3036,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place."
8720,"Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!

Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.

My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!"

One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.

I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using. 

Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.

Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!"
4555,"We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!"
3562,"Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.

Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?"
1194,"This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.  

To finish off the night, head down the street to ""The Sugar Bowl"" for fresh ice cream!"
2858,"Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming!  Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service, sweeping, clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right, but they are great at communicating.

One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing what's going on.  They always take the time to explain what's happening in a way I can understand.

Broken pump or filter? No problem! They do repairs too.  They'll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change, or how to handle those pesky, pool destroying, monsoon storms!"

1154,"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: 

The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas..."
2725,"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had."
7473,"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!"
3757,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet."
924,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver."
7431,"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.
  I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up.
I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."
8764,We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
5381,"I love this place! This was the 4th and final stop on our search for a great dive bar in Old Town. Coach House was just was the doctor ordered, that is if the doctor had ordered you to find a great dive bar. I'm still trying to find a doctor who will do that.

Anyway, from the minute we walked up to the guy checking ID's it was a great experience. Everyone was friendly and chill. People actually talked to you and were having a good time. It was a great mix of people.

We played pinball with some guy we met who I renamed the Pinball Wizard. I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking. Apparently if affects your hand eye coordination or something like that. Who knew? ;) 

We also had fun hanging out with some other dudes we met there, and my drinks were $4.25. What more could I ask for? Great bar, great night!"

Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce."

Wraps, Pastas, Salads, Pizza, Gelato, Pastries, Sodas and Such


Super darling place that makes you feel so comfortable.  Looks like they have computers to use (i don't know if there is a charge). The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.  It was really good.  The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.  Get it?"
5696,Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
1938,What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
2628,"My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular!
Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!"
6983,I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service
3843,"We only come here for the water and in that regard there are no complaints about this place.

There is no chlorine smell, faucets are all fast and the guys find your water card fast."
5121,"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
9500,"Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!"
8507,This location is now closed.
3098,"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that."
1419,"Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel. 

This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top."
6417,"I have been to a great many Ross store-- and I can safely say that this one is my favorite. Even when it is busy, it is still manageable, unlike some of the others. 

I am also consistently pleased with their selection. Now, I often go in there without much of a purpose, just to see what's there-- but I recently found ALL, that's right, all of my Christmas gifts. Perhaps I went in on a lucky day, but I can't think of a time when I didn't walk out of there with at least something.

I was sorry to read the previous review, because I have had such a consistently good time at this store. As for the store having a security guard, the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants. He'll chat with you if given the opportunity. Also, every Ross has at least one, if not two, security guards working while the store is open. 

I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there. It's one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in, but it certainly packs a punch. Happy bargaining!"
9104,"This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.

It's taken me a long time to review this place. The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.  I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood. 

Unfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered. I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb. Each bite was like heaven. I left wanting to try everything on the menu. 

The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight. They've all raved about it."
844,"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!
 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said ""No"" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no ""I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...."" Very curt. 
Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball. 
Shame too, I loved those bagels."
767,"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  

The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree."
8551,"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service"
7299,"When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears. Particularly worthy of checking out - the lions and tigers. Also do not pass up the monkey walk. The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch. 

Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes. It's a unique experience to be so close to these large, yet gentle, creatures. Definitely my favorite part of my visit.

Visit Date: 11/19/09"
7476,"I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot."
4020,"Was not expecting such a wonderful meal in a shopping center! After some shopping my husband and I were starving.....this was the first place we stumbled upon that was still serving their lunch menu at 3:30pm. For starters we tried the calamari....delicious....lovely deep fried lemon and zucchini pieces amongst the calamari pieces.

For mains we both tried the tomato and basil soup....very tasty. The veal meatball that my husband had and that I had to sample was also very good....smothered in a nice tangy, rich sauce. My vegetarian pizza was the best one I have had in years....super fresh ingredients on a very tasty base.

For dessert the gelato profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce were simply devine!

Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere (may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy) and the great staff who were very friendly.

Will probably dine here every shopping trip : )"
5351,"What can I say, this place has it all. Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from.

I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.

Simply delicious."
5052,"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susie's Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...don't forget the sour cream.   

So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  I've never tried anything else there.  Why would you when you've found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  I'm headed out the door.....Susie's here I come!"
6305,"the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended"
3455,"My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert. Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine. Great place to catch up with friends. I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up."
9290,"This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.

Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.

If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it."
4141,"I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year it's better than ever! The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends. 

You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job! 

Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I can't wait to go back next year!!"
4160,Stayed at the hotel from 11/18 till 11/23/12. Excellent hotel and the stuff was great. Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn't fly out as I was affected by the storm.. The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn't even change the price. Everything was great. The room was clean. The pool was excellent.
5021,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet. We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy. The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud. You can easily talk and relax. Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!!"
1460,"It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix."
7007,"Just got 5 Diamond Dermabrasion  On Arms, Back and Face and I Love it  She is a perfectionist,  Organize, Clean, and the most amazing quality service  she finished my facial with Ice I basically melted This is My Best present for My coming B Day  this Sunday I will Look like I am in High School this weekend with m Super Fresh Skin PaulGStudio.com highly recommends this better that The Red Door service and amazing and real Customer Service.

8057,"Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for. 

The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite."
7829,"What a great little find especially for Phoenix!  I've been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thai's Rad Na but better).  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.  I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.  Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale). Great early bird dinners as well!"
4470,"I love this restaurant.  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.  The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing.

The sushi rolls are good.  So are the avocado eggrolls.

Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce."
3091,"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for...
Anyways...their menu...
The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off...
Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it!
The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!"

382,"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  

Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. 

I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  

Thank you Jason and Switch."
4269,Hybrid class!! Did it a few years back and to this day it's the best workout I've ever had. Will be going back FOR SURE
4979,"I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!"

7447,"Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however. 

As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word. 

Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.

I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back.

...eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down."
962,"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
339,"Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!"
59,"This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.

I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.

The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page."
5510,"Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,"
4316,"This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!"
2429,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.

Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!

Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
1517,Nasty workers and over priced trash
8156,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
3290,"So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig. 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue."
913,"The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.

The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre."
2150,"Why am I trying to hide my love...

I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes, it's totally convenient.  But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!  

I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!!  

You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.

Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!"
9061,"For those of you who love Indian/Pakistani food, but hate dives, Z-Grill just may turn your whole world upside down. In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food I've ever had. This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey.

Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery. With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters...

Everything I've tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers. From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, I've only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite. The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  It's safe to say that I'm addicted to this place. 

**A word of caution when trying Z-Grill. They are sometimes out of items on the menu. I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not. If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.**

I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill. This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food. Go try it!"
2626,I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
7513,"Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too."
1252,"Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of ""if you don't have anything nice to say...""

All I have to say is this: 

We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! 

So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. 

The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.

I just hated it. A lot. 

Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions."
4520,"I've got two names for you:  TYLER & MARCO - - superstar instructors at the Y!!!

I've been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say, the YMCA downtown can't be beat for the 8-5 p.m. work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work.  I'm all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin, kickboxing, Zumba, Yogalates, Boot camp, water aerobics, Hatha Yoga, etc., etc.

Back to my fav instructors:  Tyler and Marco.  Boy, do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes! Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be, he has a kick-ass playlist of music to motivate his class.  Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away.

Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun!  After years of going to different aerobic classes, I'm FINALLY seeing the results!!

P.S.  You can't beat the staff that works there.  Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile.  Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet."
4711,"Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap... 

The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date..."
5950,"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix.

And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""????

Pretentious service.
LOUD dining room.
NO parking.
Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.
High prices.

Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.

Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way."
9120,Love it! Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.
9697,"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. 
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!"
4705,"A chain, yes. But par for the course, no. 

First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.

Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. 

The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. 
It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place."
4073,"Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for 2 for 20.00!"
5927,"We love this place. We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leave-in conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats (all for $22). SO worth it. Plus: all the employees are SO nice! And now that they are starting to carry her dog food (Blue Buffalo), we'll be headed to Wag N' Wash for her chow too.  
LOVE."
5114,"Bookmans is Great!  They probably don't need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!"
9114,"This place is perfect! Great food, great service and friendly people. We will be back over and over again! We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent (Stetson chopped salad, scallops, testosterone salad). Lovvvve it!"
2785,"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!"
1885,"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space."
3869,"My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them."
9559,"It's the best!  Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!  

The food is EXCELLENT!!!"
9456,"We have a show quality teacup Yorkie and a 5 Pound Maltese, who has issues, and they handle them beautifully! The owners attitude is all about making sure you are happy and your dogs are too! We were using a place across the street where the owner was all about taking your money and then booking you with who ever was available, even if you had an appointment with a particular groomer! These guys are the best, they CARE, and it's a pleasure to give them our business. Just Go!!!! :-)"
8492,"Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out."
8135,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....

Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.

I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!

I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!"
2297,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
5241,Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.
6378,"Probably the most serious restaurant for food in Scottsdale.  Great attention to detail from the chefs, management and servers.  Shin does warm up after a few visits - we've been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months.  ShinBay is a must for anyone truly into food.  Given the ingredients - both the sheer number of them and the overall quality I would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain."
9636,"OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few ""adult"" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying ""who ordered pizza"" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called ""their customer service"" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there...."
3840,"Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!!

My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!"
4760,"I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.

They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff."
7142,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
9921,"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!

You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. 

What I tried...

Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  

Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?

Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.

Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. 

If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  

This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. 

Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones."
8100,"First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked."
7428,"The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.  

Babbo is much better."
3248,"I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside."
4499,"I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!"
5374,"Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy."
9289,"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)

Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)"
1797,"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy."
9767,"We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice."
3368,"We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly."
9429,Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want
8030,"As a real estate investor, I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me.  This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion, work is done properly, quickly and competently but most importantly, that I get quoted a fair price for a good job.  

Don't give me drama and definitely, don't give me any bullshit excuses or sales pitches.

I'm so glad to have found David and Tracy.  They run a tight ship, they are extremely professional and I sensed their sincerity from the word hello and I talk to contractors and real estate agents almost every single day.

Thank you for a job well done.  You have definitely made the cut as part of my go to crew, not only for my rental properties but as a highly recommended vendor to my Sonoran desert friends, colleagues and neighbors.

Cheers!!"
5099,"So I knew ahead of time about the wait. So we got there at 3:30 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened. But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened.

Let me just say that I've never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got. It's outstanding! 

I highly recommend the caprese salad, antipasto and the rosa pizza. Though I'm pretty sure that it's all amazing, no matter what you get."
680,Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
7845,They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.
7272,"As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.  The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.  

The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.  

I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)"
8548,"I have no idea why I haven't dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, I've always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.

The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. 

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.

The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!"
2618,"Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever."
3681,"awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. 

yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. 

i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.

although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! 

hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!"
7322,"By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too."
316,"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing."
6404,Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.
5324,"Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose. 

It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it. 

They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :("
487,"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best

Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...

Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back..."
7648,"Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!

Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!

I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!

Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew...."
651,"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant."
193,"AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)"
7868,"We took our grandson (Sebastian) to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit.  Sebastian wasn't too sure about the carousel, but the train ride put a smile all over his face.  The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults.  Sebastian liked it too."
715,"What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.

$5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump."
6193,"We just completed our third tour with Taste It Tours and we've been impressed with all of them.  All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants.  I've spent quite a bit of time downtown, but it can be daunting and I haven't ventured much to explore and try new things.  The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by, give the history (yes Phoenix has history), and overall just slow you down to take in the sights, sounds, and of course, food!

Can't decide which tour to take?  Start with the Original, then the warehouse and finally the evening.  Really, they're all good!  

Tips: Have a light snack before starting the tour.  Yes you do get a lot of food, but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm.  You have introductions, overview, some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant.  If you're skipping lunch, you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant.  2) Wear comfortable shoes.  You will be walking about 2 miles.  Nothing strenuous or fast paced, but just be conformable (also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full).  3) Pace yourself!  Don't eat everything that is in front of you.  Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food, now multiply that by 3+ more restaurants that remain on the tour...You get the idea.  You will be full!  

Highly recommend for anyone: locals, out of town visitors, guests of locals, team building, etc.  Really, who doesn't like food!

Side Note: Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city.  They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well.  They base their business around supporting local businesses (local supporting local).  I'm excited to see how well they've done and wish them all the best (More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them!)"
1319,"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!

Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.

It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy ""organic"" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving ""all-natural"" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.

I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again."
8300,"Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the "" burnt"" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isn't a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron"
751,"I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.

We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle. 

I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).

I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops."
5223,"Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again."
8615,"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's."
4913,yummy..  you will love this place.  I love to sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy!   the sangria is amazing..  and lettuce wraps soooo great!!  give it a try!
7540,"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back."
7914,"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there. 

We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere."
8884,"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. 

I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."
1243,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
9287,"I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my ""uncouth"" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... 

It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. 

Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! 

While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). 

Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""? 

At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."" 

It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's ""beauty"" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy."" 

How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? 

The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience. 

To quote my dinning companion, ""You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"""
738,"We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town."
3662,"Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.

I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.  

I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but it's nice to know not everyone feels that way :)"
6067,Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL
3357,"I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time!

As before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?

We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.

To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!!

For me, this place is officially off the books and we sure won't be back. Lesson # 1: ""Your in the service industry, try and acy like it""

As a BBQ fan, I'll try elsewhere ..............."
2747,"Better than Starbucks anyday! 
The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as ""The Annihilator""..
My personal Favorite: ""The Cookie with a little raspberry"""
2901,"Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.  

A different food-deliverer brought out food and ""auctioned it off"" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.

Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.

The coq au vin was great.

WHY IS THERE NO ""CONTACT US""/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????"
3220,"I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.

  First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.

   That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.

   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...

   Eat here. It's really that simple. 

   Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it."
5698,"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO."
1993,"Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here."

4098,"This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour. 
Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a ""shorty"" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses! 
Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)
Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :) 
Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!"
5604,"The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit"
5808,I was here for the Yelp event recently and loved it.  The facility was great and Yelp did a good job putting together the event.  I noticed there was a lot to do there.  I am already planning to come back with my nephews so I can have fun walking around the mock grocery store.  I'm also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles.  Bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun.
8759,"Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.

We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day."
4871,"Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option. This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.

I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.

Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies. 

When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with. We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!"
7558,"If you are looking for a place where the service matches the food, look no further. This family style Americanized-Italian restaurant was beyond comparison. The staff is very friendly and if you have children, they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food. From the freshly baked bread to the main coarse, every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds. They have a wide variety of food but I highly recommend the pasta dishes. Your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite."
9515,"Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing."
2828,"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.

 Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. 

I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!"
1477,I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.
7131,"This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.  

I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!"
8044,"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.

 The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of ""Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.

 While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.

 This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price."
9020,Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!
7582,"I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned ""festival."" 

Oh, wait, I do. 

I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.

And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance. 

If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?"
5193,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. 

I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. 

What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. 

I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. 

It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
4546,"My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh.
There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant."
2961,"My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.

I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!

My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though."
9398,"Best noodles in Phoenix. This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix. PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot. Its also excellent for leftovers too."
7298,Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!
6097,"This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ. I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta. Their bread also melts in your mouth. Blown away by the service. Gilda was my server, and she was amazing. Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable. I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson. SERIOUSLY. AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!!"
6512,"When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex. He is now 25 and still goes. I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day. He still goes and so does his 30 yr old son. My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going. These men compare this to a spa for men. Hot towels, straight razor shave, etc. Hey I should get commission lol:)"
377,"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.

The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait."
9145,"Celebrated my anniversary here. Everything was amazing. Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns. Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing. He made everything perfect. He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate. He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care. We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine. We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again."
8319,"So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very ""Spicolli-like"" voice, ""uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight""..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, ""dude, you're outta luck""....

Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...

So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!"
9345,"NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.

Positives
I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.

Negatives
Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great."
887,"I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!

Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.

I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now."
5168,"I love everything about Oregano's!  My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAU's campus, and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley.  There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.  I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!  All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.  My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.  And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.  Also the bellinis are outstanding!  Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love! Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait."
9672,"Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).  As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.  Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.  Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.  OK, how great is that?  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.  Very nice unpretentious place."
9369,"Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!"
6028,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food."
5707,"OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. 

First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models. 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.

So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. 

I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!

Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!"
3793,"I LOVE DIlly's! I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup, which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy!"
563,I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
3499,"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak."
4821,"Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes."
5953,"I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too."
5356,"This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel. The food is definitely under priced. For most of the summer, drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals. During the winter, you can't get into this place. It is packed, so reservation is recommend. The food is described as American Southwest. The best three choices to have for the first visit. Is the Famous ""BIG_ASS"" Burger, Green Chile Pork Stew, & Lamb Fondue. These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person."
1452,"Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.  It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.

My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.

Don't feed the wildlife."
5809,"Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point"
2639,"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)"
711,"It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy."
1022,"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way. 

I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches. 

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much. 

After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go."
666,"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out."
6447,"My wife and I just got married at Blackstone, and I'm still amazed at how awesome they are to work with.  Elizabeth, Megan, and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable.  The location couldn't have been better, I'm still getting compliments on how beautiful it was.  We read the glowing reviews prior to booking, and all I can say is that I agree with them 100%."
9366,"My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!"
67,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
9091,"Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not ""as good as it gets"" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy ""Washday Monday"" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much. 

But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.

I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.

If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good."
7488,This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for. You cannot go wrong with this place!
4022,"Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed.  One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it.  It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.  I will probably order this next time I go.  Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didn't love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.  

I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.  

Love this place!"
1717,This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
2336,"I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, ""You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats..""

Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.

Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.

Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.

Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!

Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars."
6706,Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.
9057,"I LOVE LIFE TIME!!  It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.  They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both.  The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well .  The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas. I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a 5 star hotel!! )  This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!!"
8437,"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling!
I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning]
I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable! 
Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night!
Simply one of the worst meals EVER."
2294,"Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious."
2924,"OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. 

Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.

The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. 

Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...

Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!"
3498,Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)
1013,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!"
9679,"I'll never forget my first Urban Cookie. I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances (my favorite boutique), when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray. I hesitated at first (because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought) but gave in after little persuasion.

It was love at first bite. After buying my jeans, I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind. Although it was close, Urban Trail was my favorite. 

I really can't help myself, I keep going back for more (plus the owner is super cute). 

I love urban cookie!"
407,"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"".  WOW!

Sorry but I don't think I will be returning."
4684,Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!
9217,I eat there about 3 times a week!! The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can't be beat!
1379,"If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore."
949,"I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.

P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up."
1158,"No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream? 

Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location."
8028,I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.
1966,"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)"
6187,This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience.
2035,"Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.  

I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.  

Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.

I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.

I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.

Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more."
6921,"I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their ""gourmet tamales"" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The ""hot Sauce"" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6."
9409,"My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon! 

Keep it up!"
4173,"I'm currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although I've sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. There's a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it.
My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ). 
Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy.
Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty.
I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun.
Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. I'm in heavenly desert.Highly recommended."
8448,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.

After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor.

Never again."
4365,"This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it."
5608,"This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix, absolutely great coffee! Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school let's out or rush hour."
3352,"I LOVE Kona's happy hour. Amazing deals on great sushi rolls, and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service. I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants. None can compare to Kona. Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it. I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito. I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality."
7184,"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"
5206,"Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less. 

We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that? 

The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi! 

Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, that's with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back."
964,This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
5009,"I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE. I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training, and I wish I could have stayed forever. The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable. So many flavors! I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean, also tried the PB&J flavor (um, YES!?), Tangerine Tango, and my usual go-to, Tart. Very extensive toppings bar. Good price as well, I just love froyo. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, this will be one of the first places I go to!"
6607,"Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi. Sakana is hands down the best in town. The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer! I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it."
7300,"Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews. We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair. Robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive. He repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide. Very professional, friendly, and efficient! Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyone's plumbing needs."
5958,"I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety. 

Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it. 

The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large. 
Its a fatty, and I loved it. 
When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.

I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I""m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas) 

Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars."
4494,"This place is a dream.  Designer blouses for $17.00.  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.  Steve Madden shoes for $25.  I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.  Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!"
2295,"Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good."
3167,"As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..

And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer !
Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good !
They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .

Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha 
Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.

Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !

Rock on ladies !"
2921,"Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun. 
I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds."
5831,One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened.
2348,"Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!

Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far."
1118,"I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life. 

I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat. 

An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here."
499,"This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works."
9990,"Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602."
1173,"What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more."
6123,"I've been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful! I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!"
3867,"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help."
5597,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi."
3977,Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!
4953,"Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience."
1263,"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch."
6725,I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
2737,"Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. 

I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the ""basic"" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise."
5013,"Those of us ""foodies"" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said."
9630,"I'm in love. Bacon you have my heart and my stomach. After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it? Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. 

The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. 

I was seated in what they call ""the nook"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. 

The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. 

But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. 

The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food ""cues"". I also liked that they have those ""roll up"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. 

If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my ""go to"" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should. After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?"
1169,"I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.

They also refill propane tanks.

Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)"
745,"I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  

Pros - 
1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.
2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.
3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.
4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!
5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 
6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  
7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.  
8. I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!!

Cons - never having to shave again, darn."
298,"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.  
there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!"
591,"This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!"
7864,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. 

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! 

True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. 

It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. 

We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. 

Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night."
3200,"Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening."
7222,Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!
5306,"Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu. 

Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee. 

Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out."
1528,"I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night."
1385,"I was really excited to try this restaurant, and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out. The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the ""Calypso Pasta"" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre. I'm bummed I wanted to like this place."
8520,"Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!"
6451,Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
1927,"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  

I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.

The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.

You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could."
8054,"WOW! I had read and heard alot of good things about Smeeks and I thought, ""It must be too good to be true,"" and while out shopping for a few items today, I was proven wrong. 
I walked in and I instantly felt like a kid in a candy store. They had candy, fun novelties, and I swear everything I looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on Christmas day. 
The store was packed (it is 3 days before Christmas), but the staff was friendly, helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket. 
Guys, I'll be back here throughout the year, and you should check it out. If it doesn't make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies, you probably kick kittens for fun (and that's not cool!)."
6970,awesome and delicious place! good for groups!
665,"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]"
5859,"Huge fan of Bikram yoga! It's a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing. The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage? Gone. Annoying food cravings? Zero. Jeans? Fitting awesome. You really must try it, it can completely change your body.

There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga. The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far. They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well. Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time. So when you're staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent. 

I'll very likely return here after I've exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley. Yoga can be expensive!"
71,"Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. 

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! 

I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both."
7813,"This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.

McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.

Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3. You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.

We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,

It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May."
4203,"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge."
5844,"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony."
7072,I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!
5598,"This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS!

I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there."
5038,"I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette. 
The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty. 
My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.

Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit."
4584,"They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!"
352,"The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer."
1563,"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.

When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!

The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.

I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck. 

If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."
7363,this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!
4810,"Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley. The one on Mill is by far the best. They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.  No matter what you pick, it will be good.  If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem! They will make it for you! If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.  No, its not lettuce on crust!  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.  It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)"
7105,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack."
1323,"I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.

In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.

I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.

The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.

Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday."
6792,This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
106,"After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. 

If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back."
1531,I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!
4597,"As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile."
2081,"Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.

 I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! 

But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. ""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up ""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. 

Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again"

2154,"We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid. 

When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!

If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!

Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO."
3222,"Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state."
6723,Excellent staff. Always knows how to make my drinks. Always remembers my orders every time I come in too.
7812,"I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint! 

I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!

For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! 

Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places! 

Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!"
1977,I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(

This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.

Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.

This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix."
7674,"Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!"
4036,"i love this place. i can always spent all my money here on something.  they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too. the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly. Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy."
4918,"Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away."
82,"Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: 

NAMASTE!"
4500,"AWFUL!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!
IT was just HORRIBLE experience! 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!  

The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!!


I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager -but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly! really ugly work!!!"
3480,"There's the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like ""its on me."" and took it from his tips! I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that! I LOVE this place!! :D"
7764,"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis."
6079,"This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.  

Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?  

After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.  

We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.  

As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while."
2558,"This company is Awesome!!! I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon. I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable. They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world. The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt. I will be visiting quite often. Thank you so much!

1395,So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad.

2065,"You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like ""sonoran"" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup ""hot sauce"" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog."
17,"okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!"
5185,"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. ""Oh, Okay!"" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!
The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced. 
Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far."
4831,"had a great time here the other day!  the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful.

i can't wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes!"
1889,"My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there. 

My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is."

6163,Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind. Real good.
5346,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
8814,"I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet."
3022,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.
9139,Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
177,"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. 

Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!"
8433,"I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time! Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.

I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldn't have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!"
9264,"Great tire shop. I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat. Very nice people, and very fair prices."
5858,"This place is awesome. 

A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.

The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.

They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it. 

I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.

Highly recommend it if you are in the area."
5054,"All I have to say is wow.  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.  The portraits were truly great and fun to do.  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.  I loved it.  Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need."
8556,"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got ""The Farmer's Feast"" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. 

The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) 

I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.

One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber."
553,"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself."
7017,"I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue. 

The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint...."

3,"Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.

The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.

Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.

Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.

When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks"
4275,"I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.  Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!  This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!"
3608,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.

I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. 

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.

The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.

Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.

Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. 

The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."
2538,"I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else."
3010,Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
3483,"Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing."
2272,Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
934,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
2068,"I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously."
9208,"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).  

the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered ""bob's big bear burger"" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that)."
6212,"I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Can't wait to go this week!  
The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)"
8261,"I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.

US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.
Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.
I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.
Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying ""Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright.""
Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life."
5908,I really like this Urgent Care!  Don't let their youthful looks fool you! John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring! In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I can't wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.  Great job gentlemen and staff!
741,"FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant. 

This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.

Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.

In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)"
3948,"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching."
7472,"They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!)

The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty.

I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!"
4721,"I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious.
50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons
Good morning America"
6257,"This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ.  This means that this is the only one left as well.  Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal.  They have live music on Sundays.  I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ.

The location is very North Scottsdale.  I am not sure how it does for business, it is far from commercial areas.  On my drove over, I mostly noticed many well built homes.  

This is the only Ben and Jerrys left, and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business."
7176,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.
I am just in love with it.

Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there.
Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).
The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!

Always clean and fresh with friendly staff.

Healthy fast food .....

Just wish that we had it in Canada !!"
4344,"Well, I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan!!  Especially since she is FANTASTIC!!  Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.  And, she is so sweet and caring.  Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.  Morgan knew we would.  I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine"
7862,"I love the lakes!  Yes it's a lake in the desert!  Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!  It's the place to do it.  Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.  What are they trying to catch hmmm??  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.  South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.  If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)"
2983,"We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing."
6688,"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.

I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.

The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."
1810,"Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table."
4426,"A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  

Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  

Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there."
8914,Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend. I don't mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.
3345,"We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back..."
5458,"NOCA...  wow.

Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?

NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.  

Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm

My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.

All of this was amazing.  My fiance wasn't in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you."
4208,"I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth."
9937,"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.

I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions. 

""People in crisis need company, Droban & Company"". 

How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you."
1571,Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
8682,"If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome..."
6423,"The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.  Not bad.

They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.  That is all that you need to know."
9702,"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic. 

I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!"
5773,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.

About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!

Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.

Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!

Go here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.

Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  

Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
1772,"This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was."
7429,"Food: great!  Service: Excellent!  I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone (you choose 3 items for the filling...I suggest what I had: sausage, pepperoni, and meatball).  It was just like being back in New York.  Loaded with Ricotta, too...They don't skimp here.  The server was great too...Didn't catch his name, but he's a burly, bald headed guy with a beard.  Very friendly, polite, attentive.  Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossed...Wonder if the cook thinks I was looking at him...Well, I actually was, but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch.

Go there.  Eat everything.  Tip big!"
9348,"I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception! Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned. The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good. Far superior to the Char's Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location."
8345,"I love pueblo pediatric also!  And, also surprised there aren't any reviews!
There staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean.
 I take my baby to Dr. Salek. He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel ""stupid"" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time. 
I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied ""we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked"". 
Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!
I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!"
3687,Love Sam's Club! Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine ... the best! We always do most of our grocery shopping here. Always a treat.
9082,"Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.

Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.

Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.

Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!

PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM."
66,"This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people."
8617,Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
2449,"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...

Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book! 

This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)"
9272,"I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out.

What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.

The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.  

At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.

There is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like."
5627,"20% off with a Yelp check in? SCORE! 

They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale. But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry! There's a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches. I snatched up two really cute vintage rings."
7739,"So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."
2325,"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again."
3903,"I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)

P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)"
4801,I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!  People see my nails and always ask where I go.  I highly recommend.
1615,"I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family! 

I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!"
6721,"A small bite goes a long way. I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc. 

My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel. 
The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon. 

I'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping. It's so hard to resist. Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping."
8590,"I'm fairly new to the whole Costco experience. Now that we've bought a house it's time to buckle down and buy in bulk! As as new user I'd thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer:

1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off! $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.

2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the ""lighter"" side.

3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh!

4. And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal. The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel. I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages."
2071,"I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! 

While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. 

In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: 

- The very friendly staff
- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! 
- Clean decor 
- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see 
- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. 

I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. 

Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!"
6196,"I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.

I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for ""side cheese."" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, ""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco."" 

This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.

All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, ""this will be extra."" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. 

I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money."
5067,"OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is ""continentally"" good"
2391,"If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!"
2209,"What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  

I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!

My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for ""more "" for the first time at the store:)

I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order"
6945,"Picazzo's is a freaking miracle for gluten ""allergies""!  

Almost everything there is gluten free, and you can get something besides gluten free pizza.  I highly recommend going during happy hour and just eating the starters - meatball sliders are awesome!

Pizza is very good as well.  More reasonably priced than a lot of the chain places that get their (really friggin' expensive) dough from somewhere else.  

People with celiacs:  rejoice.  Picazzo's is legendary."
8406,"went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddie's House fit the bill perfectly.
Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar ""nachos"" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.  
Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive.
Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.  
Atmosphere - also excellent
Prices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable."
5211,"Ok this place was great...so great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place. I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well. They were really good and I would definitely order again. I was told it is off season in August, but the place was filled with locals; all very welcoming. Everyone knew everyone and if they didn't (like me) it didn't take long to feel like one of the locals. Great service, too. Will definitely go back!"
431,"Love it.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm."
4305,This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience. The place was packed and yet they got me in right away. A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job. They even put on a timer for 15 mins to ensure I got a full massage during it. They offered the other services but did not force any on me. I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others.
2234,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"
165,This place is not there anymore.
7424,"Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place"
6795,"Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)"
9353,"Fabulous place to get wine, beer, spirits.  It also has amazing keg selection."
9172,Love this store!
6045,"The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries, too greasy. Seating, not comfortable. Skip it!"
1763,"everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!"
7795,"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.

I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) 

Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.

I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?

It was PACKED! But I digress.

As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)

You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.

Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!

My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. 

The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!! 

(I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).

Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.

Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"
8606,"This is hands down the best place for bagels...
but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.
I just wish they would open on in Greenville.
Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...
I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale...
.n"
4235,"I picked up a jar of fresh-made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding!  They were a big hit!  

If you are dining at the Blue Adobe, definitely try the chips and salsa.  I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning... it is definitely one of the key ingredients, but regardless I think it tastes great.  If you like it, you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about $9 (it is a good sized jar)."
6244,Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. I'll be back march 10th!
1945,"This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome
and of the good ""Homemade"" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now."
9766,I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.
2708,"This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time."
4171,"Food Truck Fav right here!

I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.

Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!  Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: "" Oh, my gosh this is really good!""   Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!

The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)  Yeah, I'd eat it daily!  It's that good!"
369,"This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.

Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome."
6870,"I chose this place because of the 100% rating on urbanspoon.com & the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at. We were absolutely blown away. Don't let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place. The food is absolutely perfect. I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak. Each dish was prepared perfectly. The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant. The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented. I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed. My water & iced tea was never below halfway. At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture. We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant. My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit. This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!"
6001,"Great food.  Good service.
Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale."
1990,"I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.

Chompies is the best!"
3327,Excellent food! Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try. I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food. Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.
8429,Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.
6926,"Absolutely beautiful grounds. Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...it's all beautiful. Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building.

Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing. From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything. And the service was great.

The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an ""Ambassador"" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever. But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up. Not a big deal, but if you're going to promise that service, then you better deliver.

Otherwise, great stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for a relaxing weekend."
1177,"Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)"
8691,"Where to start???

The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!!

My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.  Everything is good:

Gryos
Chicken Pita
Souvlaki
Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
Fries are always fresh
Zatsiki sauce is stellar

The atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price."
5776,"My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy."
6345,"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable"
8402,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce. 

Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all."
7959,"Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs. Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!"
5843,"Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!"
4972,Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!
4823,"i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment. the owner (?) indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited (without an appointment ... yay!). he cleaned my ring at no charge, inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge. indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only $45 ... a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging. the stock of jewelry was lovely ... a nice mix of new and used pieces. some very unique, one of a kind finds as well. i found a few things i would prefer not to live without! 

they do all their own importing, and buy, sell and trade jewelry. i felt he was very honest about my ring, the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful, answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls. i will return to have my watch batteries replaced, a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold, and pretty much anything else i can think of. i trusted him immediately, which, when dealing with diamonds, is of paramount importance to me."
7949,Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional. They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend this office.
2557,"This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again."
6582,We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix! Service is fast and prices are good. The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!
3296,"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!"
8359,"Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!  Started with friendly staff...every one of them! (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested....""why don't you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!  Take advantage of the service!""  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.  

I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.  

I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3! 

Go to this theater!  It's really a great night out! (As long as you like the movie you pick, which we did :)"
5781,"Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. 

The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely."
6321,"Old school steak house.  Best 22oz ribeye I've had in years.  Bread drenched in broth was curiously delicous.  Waitstaff hustled.  THe only aspect was the salad, a waste but at Durants, there is so much good meat, why waste it on vegiies!"
851,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY."
7891,"Any time I have out of town visitors who want ""real"" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! I've eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth.
The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."
6185,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
8130,"This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. 

The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.

 I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  


On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!

1720,"Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street. 
Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.
My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious. 
I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )"
5428,"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!"
4817,"Delicious sandwiches!! its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more. My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasn't the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there. The regular ham with added bacon is the best!!"
574,"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular"
9229,Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend. Would definitely recommend!
3152,"I am disgruntled by the reviews I have read about Sapporo.  I have a few things to say.

1.  I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.    When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there. I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.

2.  I understand wait time may be an issue.  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.  Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?  The food is well worth the wait.  

3.  Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing ""rude"" service.  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.  

Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant.  In my opinion, Sapporo serves the best Sushi in Arizona."
9077,"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other.

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.

We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic. 

We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!"
928,I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!
4247,"What's all the fuss?  I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too? The Dead Duck Inn?  Joe's local Chinese Gag house? Are those places that great? Sooo fresh and delicious!? Not in my days? Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments. Even those touted by friends. Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.  It's not Pei Wei! Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven. Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order. The food is fresh and prepared to order. Even fried rice is made to order. The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients. (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).  Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle. The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great! Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese! Even with the ""stand in line"" style of dining. Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint. However, to me it's a take out Ferrari! Call in, swipe my card and off I go. Sure, it's not Chang's. Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's ""food"" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat. 

Of course! I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets! Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian. Still you may complain...""Oh, is it too salty? Or too sweet?"" Give me a break. This is CHINESE FOOD! And, you won't find MSG. So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun. But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and ""if you like"" healthy Chinese food!"
9571,"NOOOO!!! 
Don't think about it!!!!

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!

Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service. 
I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB."
188,"Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?"
1782,"Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.

If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.  

ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.

Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.

Go!  Now!

And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached."
2857,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
7344,"I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful."
3210,"Can someone please tell me why people go here???

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. 

Total. Fail. Blech."
5072,"Why everyone in the valley doesn't use this service is beyond me.  They carry every quality pet food manufactured, their prices are competitive, they deliver...FREE... no matter how small the order...right to your door....what a deal.

 I've used Goober for a couple of years they have never missed a delivery, never been late.  Great customer service, and the ladies that answer the phone really know their stuff!  Have a pet with allergies... This is your place for quality pet food, they will aldo have lots a good suggestions on your pets diet."
2669,Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
2199,"What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good."
2313,"Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.

Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.

Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase. 

They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!"
1299,"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!"
7843,"FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it! 

We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese! 
The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS! 

The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL 

Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!"
5899,"I've only been to Postino's twice, both times for breakfast. And both times, I ordered the same thing: french toast. I'm not a big french toast kind of guy, but I absolutely loved them both times, and I look forward to the next brunch opportunity there. 

Might want to get here early though - we arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday and there were only a couple of tables still open. By 10am, there was a significant line."
9516,"Yes, it's pricey, so I got a membership. Yes, the membership is pricey - but if you go frequently (and you'll want to with the hot summer months) you'll get your money's worth and then some. The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip. Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element, too!"
6229,"Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend."
9424,"Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it."
238,"What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place."
4878,"What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies."
1035,"Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the ""smart"" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!"
4397,Great atmosphere and food. We keep coming back!
5451,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear."
5382,"This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?

Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.

You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. 

If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. 

This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks..."
5937,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my ""plastic money"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  

The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. 

Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
396,"I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! 

If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now."
8828,Steak cooked to perfection.
4832,"I do not understand less than four stars. We had six different plates. Beet Salad, Rabit, Butter,Scallops,Strawberry desert, and Peach desert.  All were brilliant. Our favorite (both agreed) was the Beet Salad. It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures. 

Service was way more than perfect. One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine. No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.

One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)"

5145,"We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.

Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.  

The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.

Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...

I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.

The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).

Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.

I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it."
4085,"This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had ""desperation"" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal ""thanks but no thanks"" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to ""come back in and try on the dress""... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas."
2804,Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
2731,"My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldn't put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough."
5002,"i always forget about this place when we do a party. they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff. 

stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks. i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween. but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!"
8638,I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!  There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.  Treat yourself.  You will be happy you did.
5003,"If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat."
5752,"Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.

That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it ""seems"" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.

So much awesome unlimited red meat.

Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.

Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world."
7121,"Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer.

Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact.

Will eat here again!"
1974,"Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!"
8066,"Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait.  I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here.  There is NOT one thing I can complain about.  Remember, good things come to those who wait.  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy."
678,This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
8298,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(
But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-)
We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left.
I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy. 

Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!
I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes. 
The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley.

If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!

Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-)
They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring. 
Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym! 

P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym. 
So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)

9092,"great sports bar. TV's galore. Good food. Outside patio. While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TV's and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing.

This place knows what they are doing with the tv's. I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tv's. They also play the sound from the premier game."
6532,"My new favorite place.  I love this pizza.  I became a vegetarian in March.  So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me.  And Mamma Mia's is cheap and delicious, my favorite combo.  And my constant companion, my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies, loves their turkey subs.  I'm just in it for the pizza.  

And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig.  Pretty good people watching."
7240,"Love this gym. Not many know it's here..lunch time is the best to get in. I've been a member since Feb of 2009. 

While the trainers are nice, it's a revolving door. You are better off at this gym if you know what you're doing vs. needing 1-to-1 attention. Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE, this will only increase I imagine. Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly 're-programs'... But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee. 

If you're looking for a place to be left alone to workout - this is it."
9643,"This is a real find and I mean ""find""  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.  

My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip."
6499,"How have I NOT reviewed Four Peaks yet?!

Awesome. Even when its wall to wall packed. Even after waiting in a 2 hour line for the special St. Paddy's day breakfast and festivities. The beers are great. the food is oh so good. you really cant go wrong w/ anything that includes their beer bread. And their breakfast! If you can brave the crowd that comes out for it, seriously do it. One of the best breakfasts in town. Ive had almost every item on their brunch menu, and I cant think of one that disappointed.

GO."
8636,"I am furious.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment."
5589,"Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.

The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture.

I wish I still worked closer..."
3517,"Delicious gourmet crepes. Friendly staff. Awesome environment. Price is right. Eat here, it's good."
6129,Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area. Congratulations!!! I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza. I enjoyed it very much. Neighbors please help our local business survive. We need them to support our local community.
7986,"Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!"
5313,"I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted."
7355,I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.
8564,"Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle. 

Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of ""let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed"" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!! 

Many stores and food quality is okay. Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware. 

Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers. Haha."
4869,"Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! 

Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!"
3033,"If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by! The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the ""cookie monster"" which is awesome!)"

Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And it's not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great men's line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave!

Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!"
5229,"I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna. 

I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this."
5462,Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.
3050,"That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot."
125,"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. 

The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. 

Service was great. 

I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)"
1138,"Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.  

My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!

Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!"
101,"Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!"
8362,"Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, ""What are you doing here?"" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.

If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.

A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.

If you go here you're one of three types of people:

1) You were dragged here by your friends
2) You're under 21
or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, ""I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"""

3769,"REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!! 
FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME! (BY REQUEST)

I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!  Taste's the same as the best of NYC.

Their lunch specials are amazing.  Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.

they all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!!"
762,"Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!"
3286,"Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!

I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar."
5175,"I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and ""Small Business Saturday"" I thought ""why not give them another try"", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said ""Oh, I have another one in the box"" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said ""NOT cool at all"" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  

I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  

I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores."
6869,"Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!

Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!"
9910,"Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information."
6034,"i think this food is phenomenal. this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago. it has grown since then and the food is always top notch. 

for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy. our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled. 

it's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i don't remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love. i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day. 
they ask how spicy and i've eaten thai food ""spicy"" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for ""medium"" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT!

we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good. and very reasonable prices."

3513,Awesome food and service!
8068,I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!
8388,Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party
5519,"The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired. 

Sound harsh? 

Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.

We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior. 


So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks ""what type of food is served here?"" expecting a simple response like  ""American"" or ""here let me grab you a menu.""

Ready for this...?? 

His response: ""human food""

HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!

HUMAN FOOD!??!?!

K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.

Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.

He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby. 

How was this guy ever hired?

Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been ""yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU"" or ""at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly.""  Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.

559,"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! 

 Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
4393,"Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, ""leave, get out, now"" 
****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************"
4424,"HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was ""messed up"".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): ""Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you.""  The  ""manager"" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently, the ""customers are not important"" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service."
2426,"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes. 

Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.

Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?

But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who. 

And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
9340,"I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks.  The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard.  Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.  The staff is always friendly.  This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers."

I got 12 different cupcakes (intending to share with my husband and friends at work of course!) and wasn't disappointed. I love the caramel chocolate and peanut butter chocolate ones best! The only ingredient I hope Treehouse considers adding is avocado, since it makes vegan cupcakes decadently rich!  One of the sister's who co-owns and is a co-baker was a doll. We both are hoping Phoenix continues to build up a variety of veggie- conscientious, healthy/delicious places to frequent."

9015,"By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona!  The service is always awesome, the place is always clean, and the environment is always welcoming and friendly.  I love hole in the wall, family-owned restaurants because [at least the ones I have been to] there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food.  I've been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything I have tried.  I like being able to taste flavor, not seasoning, and their Dolmeh appetizer is just that: a perfect medley of herbs, grape leaves, and rice.  

I usually order the #6 - Beef Kebab, but I have tried their #3 - Chicken and Gyros and #7 - Lamb Kebab.  The meat, be it beef, chicken, lamb, or gyro, is always moist and tender.  Like their meat, the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside, but juicy and steamed on the inside.  The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful.  The same goes for the Homous, Baba Ganoosh, and Yogurt Cucumber Dip.  I highly recommend their house Combination Platter.  The pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture.  

Try to go around 5p to beat the dinner rush.  The place is always packed on Saturday nights, so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party!"
7599,"I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.

Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.

Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.

On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.

We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.

This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !"
6083,"Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.

First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.

They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.

Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.

Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy."
2897,"Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be. 
On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back, just get it on my own. 
Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club."
717,"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine."
7700,"The best !

From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.
I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans) 

The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
6096,So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!
2280,"Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers."
7569,"Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  

At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. 

When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!

The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.

Yes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time."
5788,"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... 

The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience.. 

I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"
3061,Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.
7574,"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him."
6130,"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else."
1096,"Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time."
9,Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
2014,"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!"
4562,"despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.

i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go."
778,"Yeah...notsomuch.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me ""You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"" 

I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo."
7907,A real gem!
7611,"There's a reason there's a banner that reads,' Food Network Challenge Winner', hanging in their farmer market booth. I've had Pastry Chef Chris's gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good! 

But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls ""Lemon Sunshine.""  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is.

Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts. I thought that the ones I had from TK's bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be. Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect...

A must try!!!!!"
8580,"Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.

""Hey! What do you want?""

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about."
3571,"Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!

Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes. Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well. They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors. I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection. The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable. and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!"
2156,"T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!

In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.

Anyone up for a burger?"
5011,Poor service-small portions-pricey
1655,"A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!"

[Verse 1:]
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

Not bought and sold, not all controlled

Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching

6262,"Postino's is a great date restaurant. Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special. You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20. Major win. The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever. You have to try this place. It's just great."
1418,"So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and ""Canes Secret sauce"" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasn't even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall, I would never go back."
2015,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
765,"I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial ""positive sandwich""

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have."
6737,"This is not a fancy place.  It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  It's split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).  We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  It's casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for."
4561,This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in). Each and every time its been great! Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!! Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget. Highly recommended!
9577,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. 

Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. 

I tried three top-notch items:

Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. 

White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!)

The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering.

The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone."
7590,"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced. Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc. I've only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I can't speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time. Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!) are just priceless. UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa."
8434,"a weekend of debauchery was spent here when i was 18.  somehow we broke two lamps that were hanging on the walls.  like high up on the walls.  like above head level.  don't ask, because i don't remember how it happened either.  we tried to steal lamps from other rooms, but the maids kept catching us.  so we wrote, ""I O U 2 LAMPS :("" on one of the lampshades and left it at that.  one night, my friend jonathan got really drunk and angry and lonely, went to the pool, and threw all of the poolside furniture into the pool.  we seriously destroyed that motel.  i'm not kidding, there was so much filth in one of our rooms that you couldn't see the carpet.  i felt really, really bad for whoever had to clean that up.  but the best part was that we didn't get charged for any damage we caused.  thanks, motel 6!

no wonder my useful points are so low... i use yelp more often to showcase my anecdotes than to actually review things.  i'm useless!"
6385,"Great Great Great salon!! They offer all sorts of services and Karyn, one of the nail techs is amazing! I'm a little obsessive with perfection when it comes to my nails and she does an absolute perfect job! Pays so much attention to detail! She is always creative and can make designs if you wish. She has many many color options. I would recommend EVERYONE to her and this salon!! Plus they won Best Salon in the East Valley!"
8236,"Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
8895,"Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.

They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.

I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. 

Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!"
6243,Love love love this place!
6355,"Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?"
3100,"I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S. here for her awesome hair transformation (8 inches is a lot, girl!) I just had my second hair cut here today, and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around. First of all, the service is top notch - they take care of you quickly, kindly and enthusiastically. They are not snobby, which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale. I have always felt welcome and comfortable here. 

Moreover, the prices are amazing! I have very easy and basic hair, and they charge me $45 for a hair cut - if you want to spend more, you certainly can, but I am fine with the ""stylist"" level (who charges $45). In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce. This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon. They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while.

I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley. This place knows how to treat customers, style hair and create a pleasant experience. The Market Street location is a bonus, too, because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new 'do."
1987,"After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby."
4641,"Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the ""crab"" puffs and the eggless rolls."
1072,"I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.

The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed ""Boston"" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.

So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.

The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.

What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving."
737,"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here."
5138,"FEZ for brunch on Saturday with a bunch of girlfriends was one of the highlights of my weekend. Several of us ordered the FEZ Fritatta and it was perfectly cooked with tasty toppings and the best bacon on the side. I also sampled the sweet potato fries and they were even better than anticipated--a standout.

Plates looked pretty. C'mon, that's important! Presentation, people. Service was superb.

Hadn't been to FEZ in a while and forgot how delicious it is! Let's go to FEZ more often, girls!"
5628,"They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!! 
The dishes I had so far:
Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days."
5542,Always love it!! so good and good price
4983,"AWESOME!!! 

I love this place! I am from Seattle and I've been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here. Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home.  I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one. No fuss, no frills. Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes. Food was delicious!!! Definitely go here!"
3158,"This is our neighborhood restaurant.

Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch. I never disappoint."
780,"Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service! 

Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!"
9924,Horrible service.
4158,"This may be my worst dining experience ever.

The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...

I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said ""most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something"". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!! 

The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new ""gig"". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!"
7434,Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.
9278,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
4183,"This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!"
7305,"And then it all changed...

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. 

So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. 

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart. 

My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you."
6382,"i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.  then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.  mamma mia's is the solution.

i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.  this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!  oh yes, it does!!!  the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.  i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.

the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in ""the Game"" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.

moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.  the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.  its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!!"
1134,If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
9711,"Amazing food. I wasn't so sure about Indian food, as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself. I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic. I can't wait to go back!"
9583,"I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.  But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.

So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.

Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it ""sheet like frosting""."
7249,"I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.

The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future."
264,"What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )"
4800,"I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center! I refer everyone I know to them. Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful. They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you. They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you. After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!"
3804,"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!

I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! 


The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!


Luv me some wings from ATL!"
7024,"Received two more messages from ""Iolanda"" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!

19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......

9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!"
9118,"I had a great dinner there.  One of my best in a long time.  It was sucha treat.  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.  

Chef Juan was great to talk to.  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.  

If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock.

Life is good."
2493,"It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all. I love it here it's clean, great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!"
1105,Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!
8777,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  

We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!

We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!

We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."
8157,Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!
7500,"One word to describe this hotel: quality. The pools were all warm and unique. The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own ""island"". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi. The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good."
6061,"My friend took me for a birthday lunch.  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.  The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.  The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.  CC always has it's own twist on offerings.   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.  
 Wish I lived closer."
9602,"I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening. My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer.

He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection. It's like an adventure every time I go. The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic.

I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer. 

SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience. It's relaxed, fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there. Enough reading this review, go try it out yourself."
4796,"We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a ""sports bar"". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well. 

Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food. 

I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.  

Queso dip: cold
Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad
Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail

Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF. 

Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them. 

Onto the Entrees:

I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager ""Joe"". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees. 

We dig in:  

Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor. 

Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland

I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot."
2896,"The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale"
3317,"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.

Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.

I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.

In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.

BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!"
4637,"I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? 

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. 

This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously."
4811,"Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with."
1857,"I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes."
6504,I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
1320,"Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.

I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.

The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).

The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered."
4362,"I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here."
8034,"I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking."
8989,"Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family! They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.

The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for? Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!"
9811,"Quick, friendly, awesome."
2647,"I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to ""turn the table"".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!"
3052,"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.

Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  

When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.

I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.

Overall, it was a very nice experience."
4854,"My wife and I ate here last night and were extremly happy. We started with drinks at the bar, which started the night out perfectlly, then we had an appetizaer, which was a tower of cheese ( a sculpture of grilled cheese, like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich). I had the tacos, they may be small, but they were packed by taste. My wife had the fish of the day, and that day it was halibut, my wife said it was the best fish she ever had. The service was great, overall a great smalll place to eat."
185,We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!
4043,"Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad."
8943,"Went to Sol for restaurant week.  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados, the carnitas that were very bland and boring, the rice was delicious, however the black beans tasted like aspirin, dessert was a dulche flan that was hard, solid and icky.  Service was average, took 2 hours to get thru dinner.  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer!

Cheers to SOL, we wont be returning."
6585,"On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff.

Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.

What nice find in the downtown area. I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city."
6840,"hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant"
1798,"BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ! 

No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying ""with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?"" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.  

The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go. 

Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes."
5201,"Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate."
5353,"Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.

I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.  

I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.  

As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.

The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.

Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!"
1201,"I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about."
9655,I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!  It is super delicious and inexpensive!!  I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces...yummm.   Can't wait to go back.
5923,"My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance. Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service. She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday. His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest. My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice. He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient. 

All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new. Definitely recommend!"
1742,"I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!"
5401,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
7740,"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 
3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. 
I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =("
1249,"Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.

The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.

The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.

This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area."
7834,"I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!"
1831,"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong! 
Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"
3612,"I like to think of Trader Joe's as a ""specialty food/health market."" It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison! 

With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  

Some of my fav's are: 

$3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! 

The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid ""Ready Egg"" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! 

Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a ""low fat/fat free"" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a ""little bastard."" That name CRACKS me up!) 

And although I am not a ""sweet"" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! 

It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  

If you shop more than once a week, you can ""earn"" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )

Regardless, this is just a great little ""market"" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)"
6830,"So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for ""the icon"" not on menu, but very good!

Love everything I had there!  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!  Wish I lived closer!"
4868,"WOW!  From service to food, 5 stars!    Went here last night for our 10th anniversary.   They never cease to amaze us.   Husband had a Caesar salad, Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette,  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley.  Amazing!!   Perfection.  Kyle served us, we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail.    Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.  If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way!  If you have their VIP card you also earn 'points' which convert into $ you can use towards a future visit.    Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks!!"
3333,"We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."
8701,"I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews.  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.  So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.  Not so here.  Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).  The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.  Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood!
(Oh - and no valet!  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)"
8304,"I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale. 

Pro's
quick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable). 

cons,

the salad dressing is quite sharp."
8307,"This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TV's...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time.

The drink specials are pretty decent. They're not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour.

The food is great! So far I've only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I've definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations.

And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders I've ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it.

We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"
892,"Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.

Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected."
3976,"A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank."
7614,"I was impressed with this place. I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer. It totaled $14.00 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish. The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in, I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full. It was delicious. Tender lamb and a great sauce.

The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly. It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful. I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants (of course in my opinion) would be located in Avondale. I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a non-chain place of this caliber is right up the road."
6779,"I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit. I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd. further north but I had previously had a bad experience there. I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did. They were so kind and compassionate. They let us take our time, never rushed us. They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do. They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have. They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth. I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care."
7320,"I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint! 

These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3"" square) brownies you will find! 

I'm tellin' ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!"
7019,"Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to. ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10% discount ).  Big mistake,  Any problem you're on your own...really... On your own!  We've spent over $3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated. There was a mistake with the fabric, the paint was mismatched, what was to take 10 days took 3 months.  Not a darn thing was handled properly.  Every call we made to ""customer service"" was routed directly  back to our  sales person. We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr, no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round."
2865,"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night."
4176,"Kaley helped me get the best room in Mesa AZ, my view was awesome. The beds were clean, and the service was awesome, with a great cafe style restaurant. I am recommending to all my friends to call Kaley for a hook up!"
8454,"I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now, its always very good, clean, and I have never had a bad experience here. Wendys locations are just class acts, they are always my go to burger fix. I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life. If its good enough for my daughter, then its good enough for you :) eat up and review."
6674,This location is great and there grooming service is good as well.
5046,"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants."
4388,"Huge store, friendly staff"
562,"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich."
289,"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms."
849,"This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me"
385,"New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!"
3679,Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.
5660,"Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place."
9561,"Well, this place is as good as it gets. Family owned and awesome. You know how at some mexican places the beans and rice are an afterthought? Not here. They are the best I have ever had, yes even in mexico. The food is seasoned perfectly and the service is exceptional. Too bad they are closed Sundays. The queso is the best I have ever had. I could keep going but you get the picture. Go there, order and eat, you will not be disappointed."
3221,"Great Italian food with portions designed to share.

And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!"
9992,"I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."
6183,"The best of all the Harkins. Better array of munchies and really friendly staff. Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases. At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat. Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po."
1116,"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up."
9312,"I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review. 

The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that. It's relatively clean and has decent prices. That's where any positives end. The food here is absolutely disgusting. Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all. None. Nada. The salsa is peppery water at best, the beans are mush, and the rice just tastes like plain white rice. I had a ground beef burrito, which I'd think would be difficult to mess up... Nope. Not for these guys. The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef. There was at least 3lbs of sour cream. And for God's sake -- even the ""cheese mixture"" had zero flavour. I've eaten better pizza boxes. Pass on this places, dudes."
4851,Just don't.
8270,"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is."
7246,"Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market. Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it's not as fresh as it could be at LGO. Milk chocolate is great, taste a sprinkle - it's really chocolate not wax. I had salted caramel it was wonderful. Dark chocolate is decadent. I did try the red velvet and it was good but I'm done trying to understand red velvet. I just don't get it."
4967,Love Bakers. I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them. They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.
8046,Love the carne asada.
5182,"We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   Both were first class.

We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  It really was fun to watch the whole process.

We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  Well worth it for that delicious steak.

We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.  

We look forward to returning soon."
8053,"My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load. Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places. He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well. Excellent customer service and very friendly.
Thanks again,

213,"I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would."
4490,"I've been here a couple of times.  The first time was on first fridays.  I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.  I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.  They had some good beers on tap too.  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.  The second time I came here it was after a concert.  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30"
2477,"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.  

The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!

I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to."
4897,"Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.

Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.

Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.

The kids love running around outside in the grassy area, and always enjoy going to Joe's."
8831,"As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley.
It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix.
I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale.
Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!

OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free ""Magnet"" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!"
9830,"I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly."
1057,Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
1289,I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
8965,"I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  

When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple ""Hello"", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say ""Bye"".

I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location."
656,"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all."
5556,"I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit. I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20. I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy. 

Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch)."
419,"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! 

Check this place out!"
1027,"I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:

Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50
Udon - Good!

The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.

Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too."
3285,"What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!"
7902,"You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."
6389,"Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back."
3884,"I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  

I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the ""Godfather"" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- 
dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!

Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!"
3990,"So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.  But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.  And it is HUGE.  And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so."
9388,"I am impressed! I finally got a chance to check out the MIM yesterday and I was really wowed by the extensive collection. I knew going in to expect items from all over the world, but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country. We spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasn't enough time to really take in everything.

I loved that the audio/video guide was included in the $15 admission price. Most museums I have been to charge an additional fee. This was unlike any guide I have experienced before. No numbers to punch in, just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen, the audio automatically starts up! Very cool, and I loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments. When I walked up to the flamenco part of the Spain exhibit I instantly recognized the video playing as I have actually been in the flamenco club in Madrid where it was filmed so I thought that was neat.

I really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the ""guts"" of the Steinway piano and how Martin guitars are made. It's not something I had thought about much before but now I know so much! I think the MIM is a fab place to take kids (and adults!) to learn and to get them excited about music. Definitely check it out it you haven't yet.

Edited to add: If you are a Bank of America card holder, you can get into the MIM for free the first full weekend of each month in 2011."
3695,"I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co. 
Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate. When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :)
Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!"
1770,"I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little ""Good Job"" on Yelp!"
2080,Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
4315,"I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!

One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa."
1140,"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been ""bad"" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference! 

I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!

Thanks Laura!"

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)"
4915,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
7109,"Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me ""that couldn't happen"" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt. 

I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last."
9801,"I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!"
7756,"I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater."
6046,"Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good."

Mediocre food
The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.
But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates."

7694,"I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to.
We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices.
I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.  Nothing fried.       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!  Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go."

I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. 

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:
roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,
sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.
The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.

I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!

My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!"
9420,"This is a brand new delicatessen who's grand opening was September 24th 2008.  Since I don't have a kitchen in my place, this re-heat one-stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking.  

They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose.  Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made.  So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave."
1875,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill."
9977,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old."
6329,"This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve ""tacos"" at this location!"
7230,"I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the ""Friggin Chicken"", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.

This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.

On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your ""Fast Food Coffee"" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out."

I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper. We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast. We had the dogs with us so choices were limited. My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups. 
They serve their entire menu all day. I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning. 
I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side. 
The food took a little while to arrive. 
When it did...Holy Cow!!! 
My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all. That is great customer service! My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad. 
The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating. The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile. 

I will no doubt be back. Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!"
2432,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
7992,"I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool. 

I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do."
8498,"We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk (who is also from Yuma) told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it.

The elote (roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika) was fab, as was the ceviche! The carne asasda taco was tasty, as so many have already said. The real stars, however, were the pork belly and vegie tacos. I'll be dreaming about those til our next trip north."
1593,"This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!"
5363,"Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I can't wait to go back!"
1632,"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95! 

I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank! 

Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite"
2100,"Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically. 

PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead."
1078,"After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.  

This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  It's worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails (""The Last Word"" and a ""Pendemums Club""), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes."
7028,"This was the perfect lunch! I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese. It was SO SO good. The combination was prefect. There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back."
4839,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it."
4650,"I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.

Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.

Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.

After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items."
3081,"I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio"
1792,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  

It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  

I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!

Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"
278,"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good."
1667,"The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.

Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...

The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back. 

Good: Cheap Drinks !!!!  
Bad: You may be stabbed!!!"
7167,"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho."
6977,"Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back."
7577,"I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality.

Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like. The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.

Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!

Definitely a decadent tasty treat."
9696,My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!
9354,"Best bruschetta I have had here. Good wine selection as well.

My favorite bruschetta are:
-smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil
-roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese
-pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper
-mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic"
6435,"This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at.  Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons.  Drinks are made really, really tasty.  My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75.  My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche! The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair.

What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance.  Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds! 

Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles.  I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys."
3523,"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh!  We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."
4745,"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the ""All You Can Eat"" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices."
7118,"I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad. 

First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.

It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).

So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food."
5435,"This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub. 

First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar. There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward. The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge). Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy. 

Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before. Check it out!

Overall, it's 100% worth the drive and $5 cover"
5059,"this is perhaps the best italian food in Az. We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients. Best food, which is all homemade best service. This place never disappoints us. We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had."
78,Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
7620,"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.

""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""

Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.

A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.

My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.

When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.

After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.

""Is it good?"" I asked

Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good."" 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).

About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.

The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!

The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.

I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.

And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).

Additional Notes:

- Cash Only.

- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).

- There never seems to be any ""Lumpia!"" :-/"

Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!  

Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard. 

Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!  

Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.  

Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.  

I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)"

I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!"
5026,"one of my favorite places !   the place has great atmosphere and character.  the bar is a great place to unwind with friends (or meet new ones) or have dinner.  Michael or Jan will take great care of you at the bar!    The full menu is offered here.

the dining area is warm, elegant, & comfortable, but you are fine to wear your favorite blue jeans.....it is cave creek. you know!

i have never ordered anything from the menu that did not impress.    regardless of where i dine, if there is a rib eye on the menu, i have to try it. Cartwrights rib eye (cooked over mesquite) is consistently  my favorite!!!    

from the fish dept, the sea bass is succulent!     my second favorite is the scallops. they too are cooked over wood and have great flavor/texture and are seared perfectly.

you have to save room for desert......the apple fritters pair well with their local fresh roasted coffee.

you can not go wrong at Cartwrights!"
6780,"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!  

I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon."
157,"I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had."
9432,"I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event. We were completely new to this game and didn't really know what good branding and imagery could do for us. They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended.

So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again. They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.  They've helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.  

I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.  Splinter fits that bill perfectly.  Highly recommended."
8803,"One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio."

7791,"Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August. 

I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this! 

Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free! 

And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!"

I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop."
8978,"I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.  

We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!

My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.  

This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect."

We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.  

In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.

The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.

It's pricey. But so very worth it."

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)..."
8083,"After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking ""Sundrops"" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andy's Nails. I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces I've seen in a while. Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20! I'm definitely going back and going back soon! My toes are lonely..."
7508,Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music. All the bartenders are really nice and that's always RAD:)

For a business traveler these are the big selling points- it's kinda basic but loads of features."
4656,"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.

The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."
7622,"They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine."
1187,"Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  

The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."
5681,"Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the ""junk"" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)"

A sports hangout, you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training.  (This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them).

The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush. Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!  You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.  I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the ""good old boys' steakhouse.""  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.

Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area.  I almost forgot the comprehensive wine list, including wines by the glass.

A must stop when you are in Scottsdale!"
805,I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
8669,"I am 5'0"", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week.

I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible!

The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!"
7336,"I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.

Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one."
8719,"I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. 

Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.

I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.

Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays."
5445,"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.

Some side notes:

1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.

2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.

3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.

4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.

5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.

I will definitely be back again.  Enjoy!"
1903,"As a previous reviewer stated:  ""This restaurant is like no other"".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.  

First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.

Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!

We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!"
2253,Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
8471,"I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time I'm there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides."
1776,"We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA."
2355,"My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!"
8099,"Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways. 

We arrived/departed on time both ways. My normal sized butt still fits in seats so no issue there. I enjoyed my free drink and chitchat with the flight attendants. Brought my own snacks and read a book. All in all a good beginning/end to a relaxing vacay with the man friend."
9474,"In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.  With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesn't get any better.  The other locations are just as good.  The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location."
140,"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(

The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.

I'll pass."
4332,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.

The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.

The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.

You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.

Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.

If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable.

The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.

Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."
3909,"Just go eat here. Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge.

Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies. 

Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix. 

Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits."
6975,"We went to this place for my birthday, wanting to try out something new. We'd never had Ethiopian food and we were very adventurous. Be warned, we had a GPS and we had a very hard time finding it, it's tucked away in a little corner!

Once we found it and stepped inside, we were definitely wow'd! The waiter answered our questions about the food, and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience, to try out the Strictly Vegan combo. We ordered Tikil Gomen, Misir Watt, Kik Misir Watt, Gomen Watt, Shuro Watt, and the Dubba. We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt. The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon/spicy sauce, and the Misir is spiced lentils. Soooo tasty! Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this place, and they do have meat dishes."
9746,"I love this place! It first caught my eye driving to work.  Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics. I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls. The staff made some suggestions of what I should try. I got the slider pizza - (kinda like a cheese burger pizza) they actually used a little brown mustard on top. Anyway it was delicious. I can't get over the helpful staff though. It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint.

Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn't going to be around long. 

If you get the change PLEASE check this place out."
5980,"What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I don't know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as ""green"" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I can't wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!"
9865,"My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!"
8967,"Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us. Had to repeat order several times. It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available. I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked). 

Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back."
338,"There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse."
9273,"Gourmet markets, to me, are like candy shops to a sugar freak. ""Hello, my name is Thomas. And I am a FoodAholic."" There I said it. Do you feel better. Huh? Oh. Sorry. Didn't mean to get so defensive. But how can you defend AJ's? How? How I ask you? Ok, so it's REALLY expensive. And, yes, they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma. I HATE huge markets. Fry's too big. Safeway just right. AJ's just right and then some. The produce section is perfection. Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls. Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know it's all riddled with germs and spiddle. The meats and cheeses? Oh, my! The filet (at a whopping $34.99 a pound) is worth every bite. Of course it'll be a year or so when I would pay that much again. Hello? Blood donation station idea! The ready made food is dee lish...curry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two. Yes, it' s called brocolli delight. My gay ass did not name it. I would have called it beautiful broccoli. Just rolls off the tongue better. I've never had a cart wobble...see Fry's review...they ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment. Flowers, baked goods, dishes....AJ's. It's here. I'm queer. Get used to it."
5933,"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed...."

1527,"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...

I won't be returning to this location."
5047,"What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.

I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. 

Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...

Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. 

Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.  

Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. 

I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!"
860,"I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)"
6982,"The best Vietnamese I have ever had. Very authentic menu (not even in English). Great service and knowledgeable staff. The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food. 

Great for dining in quickly or taking home."
9161,"I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!"
127,Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
7321,"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!

I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. 

I've tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. 

The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. 

And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"". 

I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. 

Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to."
8211,"We drove in from LA for spring training.  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.  To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed."
857,"Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable."
7634,"Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here?  Didn't realize for a couple of hours. Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered. What gracious responses! I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.  Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on ""tap"". Heh heh.."
8910,"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail."
3828,"MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! 

Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
 The patio area is nice all year round."
5129,"This place is one of my favorite burger joints.  If you really appreciate a good burger, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Kobe burger, Double truffle fries, Creme Brulee Shake and just pure joy.  First time, the burger was slightly over cooked for medium rare; but ever since I have been back multiple times and it's been prepared perfectly to my expectations.  I do believe in second chances and they won me over.  I don't get the mushroom on the Kobe; Meat is very tasty and flavorful, no need to add any toppings.  The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well.  Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger, very good, and I do recommend that.  The staff are very attentive to diners needs.  I have tried a few of the Fox-RC and every time has been an excellent experience so far.  (I hope it won't change).  SF definitely has a unique and entrepreneurial vision in food industry which has, and will make him very successful."
5712,Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!
5083,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food. 

To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!"
2237,"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink."
4965,Guacamole was best I've had!
660,"Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.

The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  

This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.

The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection."
5354,"Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..  
In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!"
9821,"Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)

I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery. 

They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow."
5570,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again. 
Loved it!!!!"
7141,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.  

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.

During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.

I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.

I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.  

Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place."
910,Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!
5327,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better."
5867,"I have concerns about Heirloom. Not about the food, which is fantastic (not quite 5 star fantastic, but 4.5 star fantastic). Nor the service, which is friendly and helpful. Nor about the atmosphere (well, somewhat about the atmosphere...it's quite lackluster). My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times, when $50 entrees seem obscene. But what they've done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full, so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other high-end establishments. On my visit, the place was practically dead. Granted, it was a weeknight, but I can't see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15+ tables occupied. Especially not in such a high rent location, where restaurants have dropped out like flies. The menu changes weekly, which is really nice if you go to a place often, but who could possibly afford to come here often?! If you do go, they have a $25 off coupon on their website. Not 25 percent...25 DOLLARS! I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMaria's latest culinary creations, but that's certainly not within my budget. I'm afraid others have the same problem and that this place won't be around for long. Therein lie my concerns, because I really did love my meal!"
3542,I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!
3412,"Went there last night with no expectations. From the beginning to the end, including the ""bread basket"" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals I've had in years. Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit. Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable. This place is a model for how it should be done."
9772,Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.
2480,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.

Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."
6920,First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.
8166,"I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!"
4752,"This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location. From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I can't explain how much of a help Joe has been. Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there. If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!"
152,"This place is fantastic!

We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. 

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.

We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!

Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!"
7968,"I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.  

My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.  

My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their ""Sophia Loren"" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)
  
Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!"
2556,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!

Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional. 

My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!

This is what Rubios is about!"
7150,"I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.  That dressing is totally addictive!  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.  You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner.

I've had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.  I've not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.  Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesn't seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.  The only thing I haven't loved so far is their Margherita pizza.

Everyone here is always nice and friendly.  I love that it's family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.  They now have online ordering, which I can't wait to try!"
4226,"I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.  

I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The ""Mike's Way"" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.

Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.  

Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.

They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite."
5041,"I had heard many great things about Penzey's, but it wasn't until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!"
5718,"I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:

THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. 

Vitamin T will fail, there I said it."
258,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
575,"Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"
3516,"Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!"
2476,Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.
7924,"95 reviews? Guess there's nothing I can say about this gem that hasn't been said. We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good. 

We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon, tomatoes and fresh basil. The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well. They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel. They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us. 

It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they don't. Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself."
2357,"No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look"
979,"No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. 
A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.
However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.

Yes, mold.

Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.

Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.

*ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive."
5541,"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. 

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail."
2578,"Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often."
262,"OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs."
9621,DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it!  I'll be back for sure!  Welcome to the neighborhood.
8957,"I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. 

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.

I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far. 

Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!"
581,I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
1574,"Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied."
9744,Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!! Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow..
8633,"Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. It's free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it."
202,"I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a ""glorified Red Lobster""). 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. 

The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. 

I can't wait to come back here."
259,"I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!"
3360,"I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard. They've completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic. They have made huge strives in their water skills. Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson."
5622,"Impressive!   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.

The ""Veal 2 Ways"" and ""Braised Oxtail"" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   

I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy."
6032,"I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words! 

I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all!

I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didn't think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed!

The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they weren't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They don't know what they're missing!"
6468,"yuk! service and food sucked never a
gain!"
7964,We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.
8945,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night. This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP. 
CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds! Fun to make your own brushettas.... 
My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable.... 
And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there! Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma. Lovely service and birthday!"
266,"Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile."
4824,"Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!! 
Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour. 
Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!"
5287,"I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!  This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.

First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.  

I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!

Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!"
381,They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
620,"I love you, Marquee Theatre. 

Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed. 
I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job. 

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. 

The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks. 

All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time."
8747,"i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.

my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos. 

their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.

green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head."
3199,We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!
577,"This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner. 

This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me."
8107,"My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.
We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!"
1856,"This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps."
1294,"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. 

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!"
2687,"I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed."
7998,"If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things."
8260,"Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too."
1358,"WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!"
2019,"Absolute greatness!!!

Service: friendly

Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)
Kung pao noodles
Vegan chilli fries

Ambiance - A+

Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies. 

Go next door to nami for dessert!!"
3561,"Amazing work!

My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her.  I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable.  They treated me like a patient at the hospital.  They were my angel nurses.  

When Dr Amin came in, the ""nurse"" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe.  I was, of course, shaking like a leaf.  The Dr ""popped"" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb.  When I say ""popped"", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little.  (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek)  It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time.  I just breathed through it, and it helped.  After about a min, the Dr was working his magic.  In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals.  And I didn't feel a thing!!  :)

I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did.  I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done.  Plus if you're a scardy cat like me, this place makes you feel comfortable."
8932,"will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back."

2835,"My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!"
7828,"This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.

I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!"
7376,"Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.  It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.  

The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem.

My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.  Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)"
9815,"we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.

The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :) 

I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was ""WHOAH!"". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover. 

The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and I'm such a fan! :D"
6301,"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.

Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time. 

Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My ""hot sub"" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.

This place probably has a ""good taste potential"". Unfortunately, like most ""hot food"" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!"
7134,"It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates. 

My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.

My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.

Service? Well let's just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!!

What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.

It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we won't be going back."
9792,"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.

If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!"
8462,"This is my new addiction! Took some friends and family here to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was her first time and she had a blast. 

Our first chef Poncho isn't at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam. He was funny and the food was great! I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan. 

Our waitress was awesome! On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this.

We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too. I will be eating here often.

Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious"
3348,"Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!"
2161,"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.  

When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come."
9716,Great food!  Great atmosphere! Great service.  Definitely recommend!!
9833,"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.

I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.

Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.

This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting."
1606,Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.
26,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!"
6207,"Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.

Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"
2329,"Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing. 
The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers.
A few things I'm not so crazy about:
The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting.
The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box.
Enough grousing I love the place and go often."
2675,"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all"
569,"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!"
3041,"We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.   Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.  

As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.

Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!"
6497,"This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.

And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools. It looks beautiful and I couldn't be happier!"
7166,"I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place."

I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything. I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent.

Butters is consistently amazing. The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that. Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food. I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet. Maybe one day I'll branch out."
4713,Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there. The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.
1630,"I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the food is good, too!"
394,"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!"
3984,"A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.

Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles. 

Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.  

Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.

Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.  

Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening."
2746,"FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience. I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside!! I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request.  I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity. The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds. The atmosphere is definatly trendy, After I finnaly soaked it all in, I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar."
5882,"Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a ""that's weird"" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say""DON'T DO IT""!!!!"
4586,"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!"
4178,"Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  

As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good."
639,"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday ""brown bag"" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.

3039,"The waiter got the drink wrong: ""up"" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was happy about the mistake, The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.  Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.  I would definitely go back.  Good service, great food, fun atmosphere.  Great flexible hours on a Sunday.  GO !"
3781,"Loved it. Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding. ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway. It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K."
493,"Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed."
8652,"My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly. 
Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!"
821,I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
2002,"Y'know, rarely do I buy the ""extended warranty"" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary. 

In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. 

For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. 

The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). 

Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT."
3943,"gotta be honest, i'm not a wine drinker, but came here to meet up with friends for a tasting. the space is sleek, yet cozy. the staff is friendly and very earnest and knowledgable in their wine presentation."
5345,I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
4479,"Great place!  I love that they feature wines from ""the little guys.""  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!"

Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
980,"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place."
4174,"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home). 

I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"". That describes these pancakes perfectly. 

Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc. 

This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a ""Jacket Required"" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast. 

The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!! 

The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :). 

All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy. 

I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."
8012,"I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices. 
Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well. 
My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare. It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch. As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit. It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy."
6938,"Bleh.

Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.

Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.

We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????

We chugged our beers and left."
816,"I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering. 
Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!"
2289,"We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!"

5405,"I dropped in to @SweetRepublic, finally, because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness, and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream.

I have had their ice cream in the past, both from the truck, and at other events, and was already a fan.

Now, I'm fanatical.

The Jameson was amazingly good! I couldn't believe how well the flavor was represented, without having the harshness of the alcohol bite.

But the Chocolate Guinness won the day. It was so good, I ordered a pint to take home. (Unexplainably, it is still in the freezer. I will remedy that today!)

The location is right by my work, so I anticipate returning, again and again.

Jan and Helen are wonderful girls, and they have created something truly amazing. I congratulate them, and look forward to more of their creations.

And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there, rather than a chain, who doesn't concern themselves with the area."

I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too. I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there. 

My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend!"

What more is there to say.  It's the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town."

9103,"I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers.  Bar none.  The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way.  The unique thing about this studio is they use the ""RealRider"" (or is it ""RealRyder""?) bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques.

Outstanding workout! I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape."
121,"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!"
35,"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle"
3182,"One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing. 

It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.

Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing."
5561,"I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!"
5954,I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
2413,This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.
7586,"It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.

The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.

Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more."
3408,"OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food."
7819,Been here 4 times in the past 6 months.  I love bringing out-of-towners here.  Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States.  Reasonably priced entrance fee.  Go on the tour - they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn't know - makes the visit much more enjoyable.  A must see for visitors to Phoenix!
208,"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. 

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.

Service=slow.
Food=just tastes like salt
Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.

Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs."
3654,"pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague."
5638,"I cannot believe all these negative reviews. 

First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.

To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done. 

The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing. 

The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.

This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains."
7901,"Have been there several times. I'm quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn, so my continued custom says it all."
6319,"They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding)."

420,LOVE the food!!!!
7787,"The single best ribs I've ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  I'll be back here!"
3898,"Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!  This is the place that does it to me.  I've decided I need to try everything on their menu!

You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!  And the mac 'n cheese  so yummy.    I've also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had that with fruit which was good.  

Guess where I'm going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.  :-)  

Oh and before I forget... When the weather is nice sit out side!  You will love it."
1705,"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me."
7303,"Okay, this just might sum it up... I LOVE YOGURTLAND WITH ALL OF MY HEART! Go get some yogurt, the end. 

No but seriously, do go. :) All of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years, and when Mojo opened up at the Biltmore I loved it, but it was far away. Then, yogurtland opened up right next to where I live and i discovered it WAS BETTER! Sooo many flavors, and they change a few of them out every once in awhile. They have all the normal yogurt toppings, plus white chocolate sauce, chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce. Hello? Isn't this supposed to be healthy? Haha, it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit. I just love it. I took my brother and he is the first person I've seen to grab the biggest cup they have, I asked him why and he said, ""It's so good, I can take some home and put it in the freezer for later."" My favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears! Record is 5 times in one week... message me if you've beat that."
430,"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable."
1109,"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal. 

Although the food is not ""challenging"" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here."
2177,"Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!  

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.

When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  

There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.

There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.

Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!"
9006,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"
160,"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

5836,"Wow...  I regress into some sort of '90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is! How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!?

Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers. The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people. If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily 'safe' to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort. 

I think I prefer Switch's menu to Fez's because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare. And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night. 

It's really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall.

We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!"
8394,This place is great.  All the food is fresh and always good.  They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend this place.
2915,"Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)

It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too."
5042,"Love it!
The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)

I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food."
9542,"Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!

Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.

The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! 

The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.

Dr. Newland was AWESOME.

The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?
- Other vets: ""Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications"", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... 
-Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said ""Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free"".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.

I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!"
6974,It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime.

I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty.

I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.
I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!"
4485,"Aiello's is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley.  In fact, I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special - you can taste the love in this dish.   Great ambiance and a wonderful experience.

2380,"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves. 

This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly. 

This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here. 

So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."

3597,"Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?

WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.

Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!"

8237,"The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.

After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!

8415,"The name is so misleading, because this is the most charming dining spot I've ever eaten! 

I dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it. First, it's location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood. It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900's and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge, and I mean huge outdoor patio area. I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way! 

The service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.

Since I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable. I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.

This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once."

She was totally spot-on.

These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.

I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.

I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!"
405,"Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion."
2274,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.

7601,"It's just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix. 

It's expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple.

I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good.

Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.

Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for.

Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.

Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.  

Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.  I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.  

It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought.

Anyway, great experience, great food.  A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef."
7725,I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great. The happy hour menu was amazing too. $5 Mark West Pinot Noir! The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay. Great experience! Definitely recommend the calamari too!
1640,"My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat. I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's. I am so glad I did. I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful. The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so, so nice to me and my kids. He was very clean and professional and courteous.  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company. I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them."
6312,Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient.. They even have gluten free pizza crust. Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like
794,"My husband and I enjoyed a ""staycation"" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends."
2096,"Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.

The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly. 

Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!"
6997,"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.

I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man"

Hummus and Gyro Delux!

Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)"

The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"

Avoid this place!"
713,"Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).

I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself."
8577,"I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don't have a ton of references to use on this review. That being said, I'm not really a big fan of cupcakes either. This place is family owned and operated. There's a wife and husband who run the place and the wife's sister works there also, which I thought was great. It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center.

I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese With-a-spoon, and a chocolate, chocolate chip cupcake. Coworkers that I shared them with, who are cupcake aficionados, really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions. While slight pricey for a cupcake, (slightly north of $2 per cupcake) if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious. They also do custom cakes and cake pops, though I can't speak to either of the latter two."
9417,"This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata. 
The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum. 
After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again."
9794,"All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat."
3723,"When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job."
4244,"Great quality food, atmosphere, and location. This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food. The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing. Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend.."
279,"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years. 

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating. 

I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."
902,"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)

I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank. 

The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?

For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)

I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"
7619,"i know, i know. this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons. HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST. it's worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle. 

the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more. the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic. plus, it's such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you can't help but love it in all it's quaint glory."
9344,"The Duce is a disaster. 
As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. 
However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff."
8595,"girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.  

make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!"
5377,"We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience."
7925,"Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha

One dude let his dog pee on me! And the little bugger was fast! He'd prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon! 

My friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasn't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant. Did the man say anything? Only that his dog was only nervous. Are you kidding me?

Alright, I got your number. In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier. Why? Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Shep's saliva. Sweet! (that was the only time we didn't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs)."
6349,"I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun. I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair. 

Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!

The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.

Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.

I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.

Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!"
4992,"Yum, yum, yum. 

I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.  They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.  I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!"
2216,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"
4566,"The best fried calamari in Surprise! Delish pizza! Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!"
7365,Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
9235,"I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in, no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic."
9601,"I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.

Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.

The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.  

The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.

The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.  

A great stadium and surely one to visit every March."

You might ask ""why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he's puked, twice?""

And here's why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I've not done before (which is hard with 4 years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you're doing something RIGHT!

My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff. Jeff is our trainer, and if you'll pardon my digression, allow me to share with you about Jeff.

We have this song in Rugby called ""The S&M Man."" Its a less than politically correct song about a special person, usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger him/herself, who is so sick, so wrong, that he makes pain fun and delightful. 

And I use the word ""pain"" in the best way. Pain, after all, is just weakness, and in my case old pizzas, leaving the body.

Jeff is amazing. He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I don't really want to do anything the next day. Its in and out, slam, bam, thank you ma'am with Jeff and Vitality. This is going to be a part of my training for the long term."

just wish they had a cheaper jukebox"
3971,"Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on ""girls night out"" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the ""specialness"" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion"
4599,"This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos.

8687,"Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Don't waste your money."

3492,"I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.

I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case."
8315,"I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow ""Spanish Rice"" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items.
When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.  
Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.  My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.  Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.

Hmmmm.  I am getting hungry. I think  I will go  there now.  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak."
9556,"I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast. 

They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.

I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.

Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.

Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. 

This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.

Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.

We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. 

Drinks: 
We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)

Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!

Entrees: 
Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!
Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. 

Sides: 
Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. 
Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. 

Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). 
Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!
Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious! 

I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!"
7338,"Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..

It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!  

their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!

I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!"
1577,"Always love the ALofts
If you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the same
Rooms were clean and comfortable.
There was plenty of room in the standard king room
Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.
Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.
All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one."
2143,"Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!"
3112,"Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored..."
9131,"Thanks for the positive reinforcement talk, and explaining, I just need to take my time. Thanks Robin, you encourage me,
I have been sick, and so has my family. I have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can I feel the difference. You know when miss something for a period of time?? Then you have to start all over, but that o.k.
Thank you again Jim and Robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how I am doing and how my kids are since I have been gone. Thanks so much for caring, weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that I have a pain pump in my stomach and   have a hard time laying on my stomach, which Robin saw I was not putting full weight down on my stomach. She asked me after class what was going on and if I was O.K. She made me feel important and cared about. Where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you, to make sure everything is alright. Jim and Robin Love this practice and so do I. I feel what makes them different is the caring aspect. The checking in with you. If you ever have a question, Jim and Robin will ALWAYS take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing!!! Thanks Jim and Robin! I will be back soon!!!! Thank you for being the best Bikram yoga around and thanks for just being non-judgmental, caring, and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the RIGHT way!!!! Love your studio, Love Robin and Jim as people!!!!!!! This is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged.
Thanks, Nicole Skarderud"
793,I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
361,Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
3488,"I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... I've tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :)

Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that I've ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend)

It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but I'm still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive I'm honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! i'm a believer :)"
6947,"Yes, she did go to another...it's a hobby what can I say.

By far, this is the LARGEST club I've been in! But my list of places to visit is still very long, so there may be bigger. I liked it here, the girls and managers, and this is important to me, were chill and nice. Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night. I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs. This place has a nice size bar, and a freaking huge main stage, with three, yes count them, three two-story tall poles (And some of the girls climb all the way to the top!). And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole. There's an upstairs to this place too! I like to wander, I have a curious sense of adventure. I found multiple smaller private rooms up there, along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs. You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...). This place is lit well too, not enough to make you run out screaming of blindness, but good enough to see. 

May I add that this is the first time I didn't have to go through a dressing room full of half-naked women to get to the restroom, it was separate and had more than one toilet in it, yes, amazing I know! I've been won over, lets see the other places on my list top this!"
6208,"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left."
4492,"I still want to live here.  It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.    

I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  

Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  

Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color)."
1716,"Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said ""we must go there for lunch one day"" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a ""higher end"" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!"
891,"Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?"
6473,"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++

Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee.

I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had!

I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side.

I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too!

One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I can't take another lunch with her on my lap:)"
748,Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
4508,Just left. I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.  The Biagga was fantastic. Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.  Owner and staff were very friendly.   I will be back again.
3957,"I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh..."
99,"After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!"
8798,Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
6605,"The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there. 

First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. 

Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. 

My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic. 

You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it."
9528,"Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get!
Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.  The place was very busy with allot of energy."
2342,"Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.

The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.

After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.

The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.

I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more."
9913,"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi."
7595,"I have only eaten here once, but i cannot wait to go back! the service was phenomenal, the potstickers huge and delicious! the orange beef - just as good as a pf changs!  I had a restaurant.com coupon, purchased $10 gift card for .80 cents!  Highly recommend!"
1225,"WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not ""stuffed"" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.

I love this place!  It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more."
989,"If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!"
1824,"This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared."
1557,"All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.  

***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people."
9598,"Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  

Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some."
8658,This place is great!
1678,"great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there."
1745,"Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.  It worked out perfectly!  

Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did, and it was just as good as last time!

The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time... 

Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the ""hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.  Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?!"
6071,"I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 it's not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!"
9110,"I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers."
7917,"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!"
2283,"I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip. 

It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?

Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said ""SURE!"" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? ""SURE! But be careful it's hot."" And oh so YUM!

I think they deserve the taglines ""Have it your way"" and ""Any way you want it"" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said ""No"" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.

Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.

But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.

My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.

I'll tea back REAL SOON!"
5393,"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too! 

Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!"
9809,"I have to tell you....

I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!"
5862,Excellent food and service!
4413,"What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.

Is it Tuesday? If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.

Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.

To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.

Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :D

I'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.

Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good."
2460,"Rental car review.

118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.

PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by."
3584,"This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars."
2189,"We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.

Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice. 

The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.

Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!

I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris."
4124,"This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when it's fall, I can't pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. I've never found anything like it since."
6842,Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!
641,"I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Don't get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.

They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap, but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials.

I don't buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation. However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well."

1937,"I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there."
1944,"Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots. 

The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless. 

We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss ""Dr. Love"" commercial comes on.

8469,"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said "" do you want to consign your table or not!"".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....
The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  

Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!"
1749,"It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine."
3707,"I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.  Why did i wait so long?!

Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.  The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.  It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.  We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.  It is incredible.  

Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.  Very high-tech!

The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.  

Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!!

This is where you want to go."
3983,"Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)

We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! 

Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!

We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share. 

Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
9683,"Another visit: 

Greeeeeeat carne asada tacos, torta and that orange cake! Quesadillas, pork and chicken, were a great balance of cheese, meat and sauce.

That orange cake though?! Like, I am one of those people that would do ...things for good carrot cake, and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges, cream cheese icing and all, was a wonderful flavor surprise. 

Gallo Blanco looks like a top contender for Places to Take Visitors. Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine."
6669,"This is the pub burger you have been looking for. Nothing fancy, just a good solid burger with a ice cold beer. Be aware this is cash only, but unless you fall in you wont need much."
8812,"I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.  

We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a ""Keg sized"" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value.

 Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!"

8646,"This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!"
2719,"Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But, No, No, NO!!!!  ""Not our policy""  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!

Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with."
5279,"One of the most impressive spots in town. 

Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.

For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!

I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire."

Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.

The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.

The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18."

4594,"Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert. 

Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!! 

There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.

I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal."

And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.

Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great."
5507,"I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If you're into used books, this is the place to go. I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore."

5212,"While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered. My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.  Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good. The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM. I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's! The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the ""stab joint"" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows! YES! :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself."
5205,"Dinner for four at the soft opening.
The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.

Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.  

This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy."
6250,"I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called. We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS! Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great. We will definitely be going there frequently."
4733,"Wow!
Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.

I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.

I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range. 

We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.
As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.

Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?"
4403,"I've been going here many years.

The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.

I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for."
9389,"I really like this place... 
Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown. 
We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best. 
Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread. 
Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great. 
I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me. 

I can't wait to come back... 
Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price. 

Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"
6173,"Truckin' Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!  So far, I have tried the Veggie crepe and the Bean and Cheese crepe and both were spectacular.  For various reasons, it had been about a month since I had been able to meet up with their tent on Sundays and today I got my fix!

Jeff and Erin are both so sincere and friendly, which makes it easy to hang out and chat while your crepe is made right in front of you.  The care and attention put into each and every order really makes TGF stand out from the rest, the fresh, quality ingredients don't hurt either!

Next week, I've got to try the PB&J!!"
3068,"I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told "" we don't have enough change"". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.  
     The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best. 
     Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili."
9931,"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy."
4890,"My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!"

3892,"I absolutely love this place!  I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.  Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.

Rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs. Alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials.

His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
6235,"Having spent lots of time in Sonora, Mexico over the years visiting family, I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border. At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience. You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but I'm willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave. 

Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible. This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire. No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners. Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat. Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone? Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora. 

If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas. Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill. Simple and great flavors at their very best."

I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."
5554,"Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I can't wait to visit them again! :)"

Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex."
6198,"Even though I've only been to Bosa once I've had the donuts from here several times.  My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.

Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.

They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).  Another good thing...they're CHEAP!  It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.  

The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!"
9908,"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! 

I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance. 

Still, one of my faves!"
7315,"I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!  Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!"
518,"These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.

I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa."
2519,"I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.

But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.

For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.

The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.

For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.

I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!"
2879,"Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends."
9246,"Well I have been looking for a good barber and I have just found him. Like many other of the reviews it is very hard to find a good barber and if your looking for one go here and see Phil. I saw the other reviews on yelp and thought I would try him out. I went and got a haircut wash and an honest to goodness hot foam straight shave (hard to find now days) and it all came out wonderful. I thought the prices were in line for the area and maybe cheap for the service. 32.00 for all the services, I think it is 17 for just a haircut. I recommend anyone to go see him if you need a good cut or shave."
8257,"I'll be back! 

Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her! 

$20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards."
7204,"Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more ""exotic"" things like the lengua and menudo!

You must go!"
3533,"Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens. I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight. 

~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed.
~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude! 
~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven. 
~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix! 
~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal. 

All items served ""tapas"" style... great opportunity to try many items! 

Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame. 

~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced 

~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine! 

~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good! 

~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp ""hushpuppys"".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion. 

~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian ""slaw"" 

~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces. 

No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.  

** Personal Suggestion *** 
Have a food allergy ?? .. Use common sense when dining. Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering."
5941,"Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon. 
The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!"
4303,"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"
4046,"Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.     It's by far my favorite pizza place.   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.     Sounds good to me."
6314,"What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time. Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them. Can we say bonus!"
5804,"God Bless Lifetime Fitness.

First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  

However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.

First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.

Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?

You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.

My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   

Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  

I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation."
6972,"I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.  

The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.

Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better. 

The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.  

I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good."
2037,"I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect. 

For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :( 

Enjoy!"
9377,".:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:.
It's got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect.

1458,"Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!"
8921,"True Mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this Gringa, but it was awesome.   The owner Dan (who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef) put together a variety pack for us.  Everything is small and cheap, so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try.  $30 fed 5 people.

On the NE corner of 19th Ave & Glendale, next to 7-11.  Give 'em a try - you won't be disappointed!"
5195,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...
492,"Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.

The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.

The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event."
1841,"May I add ""family friendly"" to my past reviews? We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here. The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms. The manager, Kaj, literally treats us like family. We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out, and we were thrilled with the level of service we received, as usual. The food is excellent, and the service is divine. The happy hour is awesome! My favorite items are the quesedillas, burgers, feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer, and the excellent selection of beers. Corbins is just an overall  great place!"
801,"It's a beautiful day.  Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning!  What to do?  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.  Woo-hoo!  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?  We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.  It was an excellent choice.  

""This is awesome!""  my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail.  Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.  Five year olds get distracted so easily.  ""Is that a wasp?  Look at that hover fly!  What kind of ant is that?  What kind of beetles live here!""  asks my little future entomologist.   We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!

My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.  Such a sport!  ""Let's come back here again.,  That was fun!""  It was fun for us too!

We're so lucky we live not far from here.  It is a very well maintained park.  As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.  I highly recommend you check this place out."
8571,"If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.  When we used to live in Desert Ridge, we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, there were times when I needed a vet immediately, and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise.  They see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, of course.  I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.

During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie/Sheppard Mix, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age - he was 17.  They were happy to provided us with care during his aging.  Sadly, it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.  They allowed us to hold him, cradle him and pet him the whole time.  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.  They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.

During another trying experience we had to endure, our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care.  We were now closer, and under the care of the Tatum/Shea location, but they were unable to see us.  This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance.  They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine, with no lasting ill-effects."
1917,"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.


Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it."
5540,A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.
6535,"So.......I love Defalco's. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. I've had someone describe their service to me as ""New York style"" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food."
7814,"UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91, did not understand the gal's ""english"" and can't hear, so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying ""yes"" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!"

Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.

I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  

We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come"
2831,"I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star. 

We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  

They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.

We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  

We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.

Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.

Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )"
7807,"Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!"
88,"I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!"
234,"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!"
868,"Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.

Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted."
2044,"...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.  

Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation."
4227,I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
6877,"Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!"

5868,"I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I'm a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably can't pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, I'm a fan of Lapsang Souchong.

But I'm not a fan of ""foofy"". And that's one thing that Tea infusion is not. It's not foofy. It's funky. It's fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly.

Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I don't know that I'd eat there every night, but it's a wider variety than I'd expect at a tea place.

This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!"

Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners"
7239,"We had read about this place on  Yelp and a local had highly recommended it as well.  It is located in an office building and not easy to find unless you know in advance that it is in the back of a big office building with a big parking lot.  I will preface this by saying that we had just eaten the night before at a highly regarded Scottsdale restaurant in which the service was awful.  Therefore, this place won a lot of points with the 4 of us immediately because the service was outstanding from start to finish.  The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate.  You walk in and they have a huge open fire spit BBQ chickens and Beef.  For starters we had a  Caesar Salad--a shrimp cocktail--a bit pricey and just okay, and a good house salad.  I ordered their simply grilled fish of the day which was Swordfish with Guacomole on top and a corn butter on the side served with rice.  It was a good portion and it was delicious.  My wife had Salmon on a plank which was also very good.  One of our friends had Short Ribs with Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and grits.  The portion was huge and he raved about the dish. Our other friend had the Duck Breast and it was very good.  We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good.  The whole experience was excellent and we will go again when we come back to Scottsdale."
1314,Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
8408,I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.
9945,"I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.

 I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.

If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.
If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?

I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.

I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. 

But to reiterate:

11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey

happy hour has most items for 4-6$

street tacos are not bursting with meat

ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.

Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.

I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar."
585,Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.

8529,Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
9753,"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  
Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    
Nom nom.

Friendly staff.

See ya there!"
7927,"The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.

 It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)

But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)

Jus go."
6935,"Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.  

I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat."
6078,"I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me."
753,"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed.
The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.
All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.
Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.
Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do."
2898,"We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded. 

This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.

The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain. 

There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy."
2676,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! 
Extras on tables to get your Pho on.. 
Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5586,"I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite. 

I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?"
8262,"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food. 

The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?

My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.

You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.

As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.

Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. 

So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.

Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.

Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!"
1542,"My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.  
We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back."
158,Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
4048,"Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa. Let me tell you what you are in for if you go. 

The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.

When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough. 

When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.

Cheers!"
6515,"Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!"
2840,"Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again."
2633,"Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word ""dozen"" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!
Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa."
7154,"We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiello's with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win ""dinner on the house"" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didn't win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!"
9867,I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.
974,"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)

Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!

For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!

Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.

Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening."
9594,Love love love this place. It's a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service!
7848,"Arai pastry is so delicious!
ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes
that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes
yes yes
i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy"
5816,What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.
2483,"Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was."
5075,"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

P.S. GO GIANTS! =)"
1265,"The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas. The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)"
1412,"I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.

If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go."
3249,"Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesn't give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but it's getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  You've been warned!"
8955,"I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers."

Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.
Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items."
9453,Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.
3507,"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
 ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.

***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***"
5398,"We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks, the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town. Let's start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list, that's right every glass, is just $5 during Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm.

Did someone mention appetizers? Yep, 5th has you covered there too. Ever tried Fried Pickles? Love them! But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over... thanks Scott! The fried pickles are thinly cut, fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping.

But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta. They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites: Apple and Brie; Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella; and the Steak and Horseradish. It's a great threesome! As someone mentioned last night, the bread is not too hard, very flavorful and toasted just right.

The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) ""I eated it"" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)

9204,"I love Stinkweeds.  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.  The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.   The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.  The central location is a big plus.  They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.  Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.  They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books."
2001,"I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.

They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!

Enjoy"
8174,"I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.

The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here."

*They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way."
3964,One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.
1921,"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...

Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  

me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please""
guy: ""you buy drink with it, 4 dollars.""
me: ""no, just one slice of pizza""
guy: ""we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars""

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.

me: ""so, I can't buy one slice?""
guy: ""no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars.""
me: ""It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls""
guy: ""No, do not sell one slice.
me: ""what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza""
guy: ""you buy two slices then.""

me: ""no thanks""

I give him the money.

guy: ""it take 10 minutes, you wait.""

I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.

Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to ""HELL"" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.

2132,Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!
3625,"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.

Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.

First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.

Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.

Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.

The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand."
9838,"Pei Wei's has nothing on the fabulous food at TOTTS  The menu is awesome -- try anything!!  The owner, Young, is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations.  In fact, one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier (we really like hotttt food), and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier.  Everything on the menu is fabulous, but some of my favorites are:

Sweet and Pungent Chicken -- all time favorite
Bourban Chicken
Twins Pork"
1504,"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. 


This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again."
999,"IKEA is so much fun. It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs, couches, beds. I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home. They have very good prices on all household items. When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something. Simple things such as Tupperware, trash cans, bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price."
1733,"Best Steak Ever. That is all.  

Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now."
7381,"This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best."

8311,"Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special."
898,"When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. 

Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. 

Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. 

If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot."
1227,This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
9647,I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
6047,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!
1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
2-Fresh ingredients and great prices
3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)
5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)
So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10..."
6132,"This is how Caribbean food should be done.  Excellent jerk chicken, perfectly cooked plantains, very good patties.  I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food."
355,We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.
7617,"There're times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!"
3855,"Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done."
4748,"This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away. 

The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant. 

The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence. 

Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!"
4330,"In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about! From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!! I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm. We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect. 

I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun. Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it! Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!! Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside. The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor. I was in love! this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!

To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed! there will be a table available! Another thing, get the fish n chips! It's duh-vine!"

7421,"Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the ""IGNACIO"" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa ""Costillas"" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the ""Distrito"" and the white ""Mexican Sangria"" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!"
7358,"I love their food. Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is ""Bahn Mi"" inspired fish sandwich. Get it with a side of kale salad!"
9472,"This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we made a mistake"".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.

 I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say ""we apologize for the inconvenice"".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum."
4503,"This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. 

The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.

It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.

Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!"
8534,"The best Burgers in Town!!!!!  I have been hooked on their yummy burgers since the first bite.  I used to always drive by this place and notice that the parking lot was always packed........and no wonder, they are Wonderful!!!!!  Their custards are extremely yummy too :)  Worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I haven't tried anything else off their menu besides the burgers, custard and fries.  Always tell myself that I will next time but when the time comes I just can't pass up my favs :)"
340,"Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.

6275,"Deceptively fantastic. Like Lady Gaga. Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants.

It's so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up. Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this! Sweeet!

It's not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites. We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli. Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli.

It's clean and warm on the inside. Try it. You like it. And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga."
9624,"I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing..."
6449,"Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment."
7404,Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
1316,"I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child. 

My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off. 
I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time."
8048,"St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.

Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.

Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.

Loved it!  Will happily return.

They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !"
4591,"I cannot get enough of LGO.

My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.

The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold. 

The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.

The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.

LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly."

2799,"What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here. 

So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.

9200,"We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed. We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc.
Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.
Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!!"
5268,"This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.  They know how to make a fantastic Americano.  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.  YUCK.  

The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door.

They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!  That is my only complaint.  They need to crank it up!"
5312,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isn't just a beautiful spot to stay it, it's also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! I've done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming. 

For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesn't get much better than that."
2127,"This place is great!  I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.  The place wasn't open yet, but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.  He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.  Sure enough, at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.

When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big, comfy chairs.  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.  They massage your face, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, feet and calves.  The they tell you to turn over, as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.  It was just wonderful....and all for $30!  I definitely recommend!"
2608,"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.

We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  

We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL."
6826,Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.
1465,"I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny."
9791,I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!
8221,"Dining at Roaring Fork was enjoyable. The decor is warm and cozy, with an upscale vibe. Our large group was accommodated for on the patio, and since it was happy hour, we were quite a demanding bunch.  The service was a little slow, but all drinks and food came out perfectly. 

I had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good! I split the Big Ass Burger (a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese, peppered bacon, thick-cut tomatoes, pickles, and onions) and a kettle of fries with a couple friends. I also had the mixed greens salad (field greens with candied walnuts and feta, with some sort of vinegarette). The ahi tuna looked really good, as did the fish tacos. I also heard raves about the green pork chili. 

So many amazing options & a great atmosphere--I'll definitely be back soon!!"
6940,"From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, ""Welcome to our business"". I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone."
9923,My favorite sushi restaurant ever! I love their ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) and always craving for more. For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll (with asparagus inside) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more. The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth! What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb! They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi. The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me!!! What a service!!!! I'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer!! Love this place so much!!
3344,"very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable."
8178,"I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.

Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.

Such great people at this location especially."
5433,"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. 

Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee."
1449,"Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion. 

At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.  

Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once. 

No fee to enter. Bring a camera!"
3227,"I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.  (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.  Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.  She is so good with the wax that she doesn't need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.  (Granted I don't have very um, complicated, eyebrows).  She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her."
4826,"whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes"
1638,"I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!"
9351,"Dr. Pierrend is ok, he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy. The staff are horrible. They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance. Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit. I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone. Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell. If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help"
5605,"great beer selection
great live music
great atmosphere
I used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight.
there is always something to be had at rosie's."
8103,"I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!"
4114,"Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.

The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!"
3305,"This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch."
9454,"Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.  

But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.

The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.

It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I can't say I'd suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions."
6093,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing.

It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.

One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks.

You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table. 
That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks.

Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
6704,"This place is awful.  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business."
4467,"By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there. 

My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great ""Q."" He was convinced that AZ would have great ""Q"" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot. 

I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the ""Q"" not being any good. 

Now I've listened to this all week from him. 

- This Q is too Spicy 
- This Q is too wet 
- This Q won't fall off the bone 
- This Q doesn't have the right flavor. 

I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us. 

Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down."
4106,"I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!  They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.  My skin has never looked better!  I am very pleased."
4121,"One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)"
1102,"This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. 

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. 

Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't."
2868,"Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients."
2877,"Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've""ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds."

A-MAZ-ING!

The best Phoenix has to offer."
5518,"Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?"
8752,"For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!"
7987,"I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.
The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.
Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.
It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again."
7065,This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
773,This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!
6642,"This is our DEFAULT happy hour.
I won't be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there.

I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And I've been told they have a martini specials, but you don't go to a beer place and get martinis... come on.

Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).

In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words.
Heck. Yes."
9165,My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.

1702,"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes! 

The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! 

Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! 

Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp! 

Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!"
4477,"We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  

The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.

I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.

We'll likely be dropping by here in the future."
9600,Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!
2685,Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
8933,This is a good store for your beauty needs. They are open until 8pm too which is nice.
5156,Best in south chandler.  Glad they are out here
2168,"The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!"
9477,"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.

Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.

Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.

We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait."
1633,"I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. 

Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  

$10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  

It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  

Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!"
5385,"My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area."
3969,"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."
5584,"I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money. 

Enter Biagio. 

When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A ""spa"" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage). 

A ""spa"" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25. 

The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon. 

I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often."
9844,"I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the ""with"" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again."
6072,"Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black! Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad. More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell. They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new. They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals. They made me feel like they really cared. 

The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with. And, the pricing was extremely fair. I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked. 

I highly recommend Bell Cleaners."

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!

Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!

So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!"
696,"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!"
6058,"For a boba drink fan like me, it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea (and not just milk powder), hot or cold tea choices, and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately.

I ordered an iced chocolate chai (yum! such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses) with boba.  The only negative is that the drink was $4.91, but it was well worth it!  Mmmmmmm love this place!"
2111,Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
3552,"The staff of this ""establishment"" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, ""trendy"" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.

I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.

Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange."
7665,"Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!"
6837,One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :)
927,"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
189,"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of."
5594,"I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !! 

Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review. 

I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.  

I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!"
6664,"Do you hate shaving as much as I do? Do you find waxing too painful and expensive every 6-8 weeks?  Well I have the answer for you!!!  Go see Cindy Semerdjian at Cosmetic Laser Solutions.  I was introduced to Cindy through a friend AND NOW I AM HOOKED!!!   Not only do I no longer have hair, it is very inexpensive!  How much did it cost for you to get waxed...what would you say if I told you for a few dollars more the hair would be gone...PERMANENTLY!   

Cindy offers a free initial consultation.  A few prices that I have experienced on a per session basis is: underarm - $100 ; bikini (brazilian) - $100; full leg (both) - $250.

I highly, highly recommend going to see Cindy!  Tell her Jillian sent you!    

So get started today to get ready for summer!"
3092,I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
3708,"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be! 

Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library."
7251,"I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.

They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good."
1119,"What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving.
The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.
Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation."
4129,"Oh, where to begin..

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. 

I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food."
3145,"This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.

The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace."
5076,"Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side. 
Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good!
It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly.
A gem!!!"
6948,"Absolutely adorable!

This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.  

Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.

Cheers!"
7470,"This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas. 

For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.

Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.

From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike. 

For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.

For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider."
2752,"I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.  

There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.

I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.  

Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended."
5032,"I love this mall. You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside! It is one of the only indoor malls that I like. I feel so calm when I am here. You can find just about anything in this mall.  The food court is pretty good.  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.  Plenty of parking or you can just valet.  My favorite Nordstroms is here.  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes."
2997,"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.  

From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)

The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.

The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.

9052,"This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch."
1991,"This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.
Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!
 The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!"
7946,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!"
1377,"NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list."
9939,We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
7398,"I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.

The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.

Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.

The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food."
3955,"We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units, then decided to rent for a while first.  We've been here almost a year & loved it at first, but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.   The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.  It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise, but that doesn't work.  We've called security several times, but it never seems to help.  The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.   Aesthetically this place looks great.  The gym is great too, but the construction is horrible."
8795,"Authentic mouth watering food.
Got the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied."
7604,Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!
3978,"Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious."
244,Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
2810,"bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool. 

plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.

it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent. 

the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...

if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.

customer service is very nice and helpful."

509,"I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.

Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that."
2545,I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
3190,"I've been here 3 times.  The first was fair, so I gave it another shot, second time fair again, third time (kyoto was closed soooo....) let me start by saying, I've been in the service industry for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad service.  If they had been busy this would be one thing, but there was us and a few people at the bar.  NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER.  The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt... medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside.  Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.  We didn't complain, but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.  We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill, just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong. BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.  There are better places to spend hard earned money."
6805,"I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better!!!   The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies....oh my goodness.   Every time I'm in phoenix, this is my must go see do eat spot!!  The owner Frank is awesome."
5105,Excellent
9943,"Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.  It was perfect.  Lots of flavors to choose from.  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.  You can either eat inside or outside.  The place is decorated so cute.   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.  He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.   We will be back very soon.  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.  You won't be disappointed."
599,"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!"
8248,"Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias."

3953,"This is a true gem! I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him. I read the reviews and gave this place a try. I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable. He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!"
3643,"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit."
6600,"Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!"
1280,"Love Love Love! 
All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth.."
6146,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back."
2292,"I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.

I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour."
3835,"I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.

Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)"
2016,Amazing. Romantic!
145,Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
982,"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.  

It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!"

They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out. I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish. There's so many cool home furnishings here as well, unique non-mainstream stuff that's fairly reasonable in $$. I've actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet... purchasing it may be in my very near future!"
7403,"After a long week of being trapped in a conference room, I really really needed to be outside.  Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place.

This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends.  I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude, so I arrived as the sun was rising.  Good choice - there were only a few others around on this chilly morning.

The 3+ mile trail is an out-and-back route, with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting.  Like a stairmaster, but better because you aren't in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person.  The well-maintained path is packed gravel, so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping.

For those that want to take their time and learn a little, there are small signs along the route that label various plants, as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance.  

Get up!  Go outside!  You will love it as much as I do."
8331,"As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!"
2141,"I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.

Great strore!"
1059,"I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff. Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a big,clear picture of the baby. Also, the  large spacious rooms are really nice. On a side note, they have great products to buy in the lobby.

Now pregnant with my 2nd baby, my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds. Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds. I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks."
8898,Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome. Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet. If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it.
3056,"Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special."
1554,"This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karen's Kreamery Cafe'. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business...
Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you haven't been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!"
4590,"Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too."
3862,"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...

I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  

You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good

Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  

Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  

Love this place!!"
3628,"I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. 

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. 

The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. 

We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. 

Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend."
8569,"This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).

Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.

Really not sure what the fuss is about."
3627,"I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead."
3232,"When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind?
No, I'm not talking about a salad, I'm talking about an ice cream sundae!

Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled:

Basil Lime Sorbet
Salted Butter Caramel
Apple Pie
Dessert Honey
Maple Pecan
Almond Buttercrunch
Cashew Turtle

All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious. 
My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing.

The service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's. 

I'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go. It was so yummy!"
5880,"I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!"
6722,"I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say."
5558,"This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!"
176,The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
8265,Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix.  Accutemp has a new customer for life!  Highly recommend!
5023,"This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it."
6887,"Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down"
2084,"Easily the worst ""burrito"" I have ever had.
It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better."
6002,"I went to Tommy V's for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clients...WOW!  This is my new favorite restaurant in town!  They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off, which is perfect for a business dinner.  I am vegan, one of his clients is doing the paleo diet, and another is gluten free, and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us, while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  I am just sorry I haven't discovered it earlier.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  P.S.  Very cool atmosphere, too!"
8340,"Sunridge Canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since I first played it 6+ years ago. I have to admit I did work here for a two-year span several years ago, but it was one of my favorites before, during, and since then.

It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk). The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time. You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e. We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley. I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.

Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex. It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad). It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one. 

They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35. I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts. I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens. It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $35 course here in town.

One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here. As in, it gets windy every day. The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time. An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back-nine without the wind gusting in your face."
5492,"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.

Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.

My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.

Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  

Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.

What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."
1058,"Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place."
7880,Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.
2462,"Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place."
3807,"Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!"
7253,"This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.  

Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.  

If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am."
4822,"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. 

This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. 

Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. 

Go and try not to get hooked. 

Enjoy!"
1659,We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
4228,"This place was once known as J Chew and Company. I loved that place and this new version is still great.

So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best."
9113,"We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.  Very fresh tasting!  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again."
1928,"Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. 

For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. 
The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. 

The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again."
9074,"Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.

And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too."
8055,"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.

The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)

The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" 

Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.

It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.

If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)

I think it's too small for groups over six.

Maybe we'll see you there.

Added 11/18/07
I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""
Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad."
9914,"Best Cakes around!

This may sound crazy, but I've never actually been in this place.  But I've tried so many different things they have.  

My job goes through Karsh's for all the anniversary cakes, catering, and special events.  We get cookies, cakes, and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karsh's.  Recently, my coworkers wanted to try something different.  They got an eclaire, cake balls, and mini rainbow cakes.  The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth.  I could eat those for days.  They just melt in your mouth plus they're covered with chocolate.  What?  Yes!

My friends also got me a Karsh's cake for my birthday a few years ago.  I wish I had a picture of it.  It was so pretty with a butterfly on it.  And it tasted amazing.

Though I've never been a paying customer and I've never walked through their door, I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing."
2197,"One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa. 

I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!

I eat the entire plate every time."
3705,"The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. 

I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)"
2539,"The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. 

Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.

EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium."
1189,"I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have."
9495,"I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare."
8106,"Awesome.

So much better than parking on site.

Safe and good prices keep me coming back.

Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day."
955,"I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting) 
So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer."
9303,"When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits."
8922,"I had lunch at Lon's and wow, what a great experience.  Great food, great service and great ambiance outside.  I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly.  Maybe he was having a bad day?  His unfriendliness aside, this is a must try if you are  in the area."
5778,"Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts. It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!

They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes. Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice. Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts. They're such pretentious jerks sometimes. 

Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice. They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese. Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random. I will never stray from Sunflower again!"
425,"I love boba drinks but hate the word ""boba"". I always feel like an ape when I say that word. 
 
Anyways.

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.

I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good."
7768,"We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - that's how we found Kazimierz.  Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.  

We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people. 

The bartenders were great, as so was the music.  I will, without question, be going back."
9620,"OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I am definitely going here again, what a find!"
4583,"I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal."
4180,"Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes. It's always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet.

The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office. I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching. Did I mention that I kind of like this place?"
1437,"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out.
Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)"
6552,...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!
4946,"All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection."
6167,"From the outside you wouldn't guess the kind of school it is - its in a strip mall, its small, not very well known - but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed.  This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.  You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not. You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.  If you haven't come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should - you are missing out."
5690,"I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER!
the vibe is young clean and fresh. 
the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:"
4790,"Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place."
6566,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though."
51,"Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  

Did you catch that?

DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!"
5397,This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.
3495,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
7227,"I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.

Pros:
Quick service
Cheaper than the spa, salon

Cons:
Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)

The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.

The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to."
7575,"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months."
3883,"This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it."
5417,Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!
779,"The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!! TV's everywhere, if you love sports and beer this is the place for you!! The nob has events all week and food specials to go along... the ribs are amazing!! however the GYRO is good as it gets!! The best gyro in the valley you can write that one down!! and the wings... once you pop u just cant stop!!

HOB NOB SPORTS BAR & GRILL cheers to you!!"
6769,"I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.
My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.  
Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on."
8010,"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.
 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.
  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!"
6122,"This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).  It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years.  It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public!  Thank you, Save Your Dairy!"
4577,"Best pizza in AZ, hands down."
6177,"Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.

Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service. 

I absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation. 

I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway."
9917,"I'm not generally a big fan of burgers, but I love this place!  Their ""blu burger"" is amazing!  Bleu cheese crumbles, carmelized onions and thick, crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun, oh my!  I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well.  I can't speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new. Heh.

The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow well-behaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal.  They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl!

I've also had great luck with their waitstaff, everyone is friendly and on task.  It's pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch."
9222,"This place had amazing food for reasonable prices. They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food. The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok. I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore. The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there. It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back. Don't dress too casual..."
630,"This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.

I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either."
4609,"We have been here now several times.  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to.  The food and service is absolutely the best.   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen.  Everything off the grill is awesome.

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:

For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro ""tour"" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.

Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.

Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.  
Did it once.  It's a bit long for us and wont do it again."
6531,Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.
4278,"Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye.."
8724,"HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.

On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.

Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.

Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.

When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.

When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.

Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. 

Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.

What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service."
5284,"Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.

We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS ""Check Please, Arizona"".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.

Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us."
2074,My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!
9822,"Went early  to North for the New Year's eve special menu. 3rd time dining here. They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event, but as with the previous meals, it was outstanding. Hubby had the misto fritto, they always do the crisp calamari perfect. Enough just to make a special trip for it. I had the beef carpaccio, buttery and flavorful. The apple cider pork tenderloin was tender, moist and it was a huge portion. My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone. Oink. I had the scallops. Always a favorite of mine. They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special. We both had the hazelnut chocolate cake. Sinfully rich. We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Year's countdown. 
We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants."
8382,"Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place! Quite a dive in terms of decor, so don't expect anything fancy. There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly.

Anyway, I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD. The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it. They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!). So before you knock it, if you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!"
9607,"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! 

FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.

No value means lost customers ...."
1156,"This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. 
They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!"
8928,"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!
She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  
This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts."
1424,"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet."
7999,"WOW.  This places is incredible.  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.  Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of ""man food"".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeño or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)"
7884,"I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere."
5988,"I lived in AZ for a year whilst at JP Morgan. One of the few great experiences i had out there (back in LA now) was, going to their Good (yes, capital G) food places, they were really really, really Good...certainly on par with eateries I've experienced in London, NYC, Paris, et cetera.
I finally found a neighborhood that had (gulp) personality: the Roosevelt district. I was so happy and comfy in my hundred-year-old guest house with hard wood floors, huge pre-air conditioning windows, a sizable green backyard, and an unobstructed view of the teenytiny Phoenix skyline. And just down the street from my extraordinary little residence was the absolutely amazing, wonderful and perfect Tammie Coe (the person AND the bakery) who had just opened their venerable doors.
I was there every morning for their exquisite breads, cheeses, sweet things, perfect euro-standard coffee, lovely attendants....I miss it so much.
It reminded me of Patisserie Valerie in London, or any good bakery in Paris...with a cool, fun and welcome American twist.

I shall always go back to Tammie when ever I find myself in dreary Walmart-ized Phoenix. Tammie, you are an artist. My only hope is that you will consider opening a location in Los Angeles. Eat your heart out, Nancy Silverton!!!"
9143,"Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!"
8690,Great multigrain sandwiches. Nice patio too!
4225,"this place is awesome. GO. & soon - already decent wait times. 

OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks. yeah, yeah. shut up.

GO GO GO."
360,"I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!

My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.

I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!"
2153,"love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey"
9806,"If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down. It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =) 

This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!"
7108,"I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the ""basement"" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return."
5691,"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or ""no Tip"" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific."
7563,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else.""
I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."
635,"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation."
212,"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."
5537,"My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school. As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me. I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lil'un and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her. 

The lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons. They really believe in the product that they sell. 

Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids. I know they do parent and child classes here also."
8765,Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around. The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start! I also like their orange beef! Definitely worth to eat for!
9359,"Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.

I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding. 

Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews."
6395,"i've been eating at bison witches for 7 years now.  i started in tucson when i went to UA, and even though this one is on ASUs campus, i'll go because the food is that good.
i almost always get the soup and sandwhich combo - the sundevil (in tucson its the wildcat) and the cream of brocolli soup.  yummm!!  they give you plenty of soup in a bread bowl, and if you're like me and like to dip, they give you the top of the bread bowl that they cut off.  they also give you the insides of the bread bowl too!  as everyone else has said, the sandwhiches are huge!!  you could order just half a sandwhich and be good, but you would be missing out on some deliciousness.  and you get all this food for just $7.75 (when i first started eating here, it was only $6.50, which was perfect for the poor college kid).
i've also had their chicken cheese nachos, which is a cafeteria tray filled with tortilla chips, covered in lettuce, tomatoes, queso and cubes of chicken.  it's an appetizer, but could definitely serve as a meal for 2.
also tasty their chili and chili con queso.  yummm...."
2321,"If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well. 

In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it? 

You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you. 

We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health."
9503,Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.  Staff and management were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend.
4396,"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar. 

The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now. 

Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too."
2088,"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  

Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   

Other than that, what a great place to go!"
3836,One of the few legit brewpubs around.
8838,"Been a patron since this eatery first opened.  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.  The food is that fabulous!  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.  

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)

Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.  :-)  Happy Eats!"
1253,"I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing!

My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were ""the king's"" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you, Ariel!"
2594,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.  

GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!"
8361,House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!
2665,"Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free.
One last thing, they have free wifi!"
6782,Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.
5154,"Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat..."
5646,"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...

There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use ""Talent"" or ""Creativity"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.

The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.

Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!"
1704,"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back"
5347,I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!! Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!!
9834,"I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure. However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients."
3747,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
9864,"First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience. 

You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all. 

We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way. 

We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul. 

Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!"
1112,"This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.  If you like buffets, do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!!"
1313,Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
4395,"Always treat me well, very honest!!"
1087,"Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.  

Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)

Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc."
3095,"I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it."
7216,"Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again."
4391,OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.
4564,My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.
3423,"3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, ""how long"" and with much joy he replied, ""I can get your food in 10-15 minutes"".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!

Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change."
3294,"I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue. Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more. What is that demographic exactly? ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities. Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right. 
Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights:
The margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.)
The chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious.
 The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones.
The ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale).
To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place."
1656,"Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.


-Thanks for reading this little novel."
2847,"In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!

Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.

Highly recommended."

In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast"
2250,"Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!"
8281,Best customer service you can find! I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guys!James the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you have.he will even probe your snakes for free!Every animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shape!Their prices are great and the employees are awesome!I suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predators.Give em a shot you will be glad you did!

6458,I discovered this place by going on one of my usual 20 mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up. I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent. The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu. I can't wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend.
3355,Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
572,"Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?"

7751,"Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in. 

The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good. 

It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!"

4094,"I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again. 

Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them. 

Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke."
8226,"My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family."

1530,The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.

http://www.flickr.com/people/tysoncrosbie/

I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.

Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.  Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.

Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him. The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants. Really, his work is that good. For real. No joke. I'm serious. Totally serious.  I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.

Where is the button for 5 million stars?!!!"
6482,"Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good!

I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for 'third wave coffee' (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.  

I don't 'like' coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!  

So that's the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star?? I just can't believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if that's true then it's completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.  Run, don't walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe."
749,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. 

It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... 

I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. 

Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week."" 

i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"
7313,Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
368,"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing."
8423,"The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. 

One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill."
8478,"At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.

Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.

In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it. You just might fall in love."
3164,"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world. 
 All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully. 
 They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think."
2788,"For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting."
7466,"I've often driven by here, & figured I'd go in & take a look sometime. 
But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.  

When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund.

This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, ""sorry out of stock""s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.  

So I thought to go into the iStore. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked. Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & it's peripherals and MacBook Pro's (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the ""really-really-smart"" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything. 

So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!"
9260,Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!
4398,Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition
2535,"I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.

It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.

Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me."
3985,"Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur. 

This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.

If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand. 

Tiny servings.

The good. Friendly wait staff.

If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill."

3169,"Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best."

Try the buffet you will not be disappointed.
Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups."
3647,"I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.  

During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".

She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.

""Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits""?

Dude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae."
9326,"Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good. You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice. The huckleberry margarita is so good, I've had three in one sitting (no, I wasn't driving!). I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering. It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large."
8445,"If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles.
A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable.
A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out. 
Yay!"
65,"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said ""they try the best they can""  hmmmmmm isn't this a ""fish"" restaurant? 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back."
5478,"My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.

We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.

My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite! 

What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!"
7701,"We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.

Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.

In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu. 

We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.

(The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)"
30,"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.

That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.

I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby."
8672,"I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.

Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.

We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.

Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper."
3223,"i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended."
2133,"The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!"
6542,"Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State...

Sure, it's a man-made water source, and yes - it's pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but it's gorgeous during the day and at night too!

I've done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well... 

With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter what's going on there...

My only words of wisdom - don't swallow the lake water!"
3332,"Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.

Definitely recommend coming here!"

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees.

Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to ""promote good coffee in Arizona"" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!"
7593,"I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week. I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats. I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata. And the bakery... oh, the bakery. They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake. 

The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses. Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!"

I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good. 

If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.

Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.

While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!"
6964,"Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.  I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Don't miss out on the Peaks."
7377,"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!
My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."
1207,"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it."
9901,By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Food and Salsa amazing! Service phenomenal! Great prices!!!!
8907,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. 

The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that."
9779,"Fast, friendly, and clean.  You don't get to say that too often when describing a post office!  Serously though, these guys are great."
3610,"This little taco shop gets 5+ stars! 

The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home. 

I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50."
3465,"I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)"
2658,"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year."
1270,"Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef,  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind,  use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil,  YUK!  It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor,  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef,  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick,  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!"
6082,"Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner. It's both affordable and healthy. Thought it's usually  crowded with ""Hipster"" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service. Our food has usually come out in a timely matter.

As for the environment, It's very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it's very well lit.  It's nice and open so you can see what's going on through out the restaurant. It's never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date.

Almost every visit, I've always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say ""Ooh, what's that?!"""
1496,Yum best donuts in Phoenix.
1025,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything."
6553,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
9128,I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.
1734,"in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. 

this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.

the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced ""mah jer lees"" like i had thought.... it's pronounced ""mar lees"". so let me get that out first.

i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. 

being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:

a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.

the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons

the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. 

so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. 

oh, and GO PACK GO!!!"
3125,"Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.

My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.

The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas. 

Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost."
5534,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.

This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  

The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  

I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! 

P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!
(ku-doh-ba???)"
752,"This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink."
4677,"My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance. We got lucky. The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked. My wife's fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach. We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler."
6238,"I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club. I'll be go back. I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Hold'em poker. The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker. They have succeed."
3270,"Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.

IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park."
8820,"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..
I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, ""Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS."" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future."
7056,"This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!"
756,35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
2498,"short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack. 

I can't wait until they come back!"
8503,Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.
4929,"I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.
The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.
Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am,
I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.
I highly recommend CCO."
5315,"I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location.

I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience.

Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts.

Think I'm joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/

Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there."
2683,"Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.  

Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.  

If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well."
4603,"I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claire's when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!"
8693,"This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone!
Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......"
3715,"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."
1794,"I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare."
7469,"I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience."
8065,"ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black ""stuff"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again."
6446,"What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores."
1311,"Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment."
5946,"Never disappointed with this place!

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!"
9793,"I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle. I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight. Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious. Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go. SOOOO good! Also, servers are super nice and prompt. YAY!"

7259,"Thanks to Chris L's first review, OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I just can't seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings.  Today was the day.  I was ready by 9 (am, not pm)!

After a quick stop at the ATM, we were there, Yelp canvas bags in hand, and not disappointed.  I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery.  I sampled an itsy, bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth.  We also purchased zucchini bread, honey (which I've already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries), grapefruit marmalade (yum), dates, and fresh flowers.

The breakfast burritos from Gil's Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos.  Saving for next time...fresh produce (the lines were already long for McClendon's and I'm not one to wait for veggies) and everything else I wanted (like tamales).

We saw our own Gabi K's other half wandering down the street too...he looked so lost without her:(  Hope he brought her some flowers."
856,"I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  

I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!  

 Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!"

3156,"When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!  

Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Can't beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, don't sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!"
2900,"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a ""hot dog"" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than ""a hot dog"" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog. 

Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie... 

My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!). 

You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?"
8233,"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!"
8499,"Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!

I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms)."
6228,"One of my fave places in Phoenix.
Well stocked and friendly staff.
I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look.
That's when Border's became one of my fave places.
I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD.
I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before.
I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness.
For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for.
I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in.
Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at.
I bought that too!
I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
6854,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. 

We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch.

If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.  

Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort."
8948,"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.

The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling."
9911,"Been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides. Nothing was disappointing. I have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog. Both dogs were great and had very distinct high points. The sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods. I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat. The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair. The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth.

The sides were good to. The chili is not some canned stuff and is good. The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave.

If you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down."
293,"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume."
341,"This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule."
2311,"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!"
7104,"This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!) and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).  I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).  I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel. all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap. It's sunshine in your shower)

Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!  Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute).

This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)"
9111,"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close. 

 Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place. 

  I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.

 Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at ""chefing"" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.

Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating."
6787,"Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!

Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.

Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.

Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can."
2180,"Championship establishment here.

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment."
9396,"Pros: 
-No breed restrictions on dogs

Cons: 
-Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly.
-Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time)
-Trash divers daily that no one does anything about
-No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a ""courtesy patrol"" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed
-Vandalized cars 
-A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire)
-The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed. 
-Bug infestations in most apartments
-Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all
-The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff
-Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking
-The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame, either. 

If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it."
2661,"Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.

Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!

Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!

I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  

So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!"
9756,"Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  

Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill

Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.

Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.

Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches"
554,"Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!"
2575,"Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......"
